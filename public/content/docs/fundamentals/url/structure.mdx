# The Building Blocks of a URL

A complete URL can be broken down into several parts, each with a specific purpose.
Let's analyze this example:

```
https://www.example.com:443/path/to/page.html?param1=value1&param2=value2#section1
```

Here's a breakdown of each component:

1.  **Scheme (or Protocol):**
    - This is the very first part of the URL, followed by a colon (`:`) and two forward slashes (`//`).
      It tells the browser _how_ to access the resource - which protocol to use.
      - The most common scheme is `http://` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the foundation of data communication on the web.
      - `https://` (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting the communication between your browser and the server to protect your data.
        While crucial for sites handling sensitive information like online banking or shopping, `https://` is now considered the standard for all websites, even those not dealing with sensitive data.
    - Other schemes exist, such as `ftp://` (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers and `mailto:` for initiating email messages.

2.  **Domain Name:**
    - This is the human-readable name of the website, like `example.com`.
      It's what you typically remember and type into your browser.
    - DNS (Domain Name System) translates this domain name into the server's numerical IP address.
      For more information, see the [DNS page](../ip-and-dns/dns).
    - The domain name often includes a _subdomain_, which appears before the main domain name.
      The most common subdomain is `www`, but others exist, like `blog.example.com` or `shop.example.com`.

3.  **Port (Optional):**
    - The port number, preceded by a colon (`:`), is like a specific "door" on the server.
      Different services on a server listen on different ports.
    - If the port is omitted, the browser uses the default port for the specified protocol.
      For `http://`, the default port is 80.
      For `https://`, the default port is 443.
    - Because these are the defaults, you usually _don't_ see the port number in most URLs.

4.  **Path:**
    - The path, starting with a forward slash (`/`), specifies the location of the resource _within_ the website's file structure on the server.
      It's like a directory path on your computer.
    - For example, `/products/shoes/running.html` would point to a file named `running.html` located in the `/products/shoes/` directory on the server.

5.  **Query String (Optional):**
    - The query string, starting with a question mark (`?`), allows you to pass additional information to the server.
    - It consists of _key-value pairs_, separated by ampersands (`&`).
      For example, `?category=shoes&color=blue` would send two parameters to the server: `category` with a value of `shoes`, and `color` with a value of `blue`.
    - Query strings are often used for search queries, filtering data, or form submissions.

6.  **Fragment Identifier (Optional):**
    - The fragment identifier, starting with a hash symbol (`#`), points to a specific section _within_ the web page.
    - For example, `#reviews` would tell the browser to scroll to the element on the page with the ID `reviews`.
      This is often used for navigating to specific sections within a long document or for creating single-page applications.

## Absolute vs. Relative URLs

URLs can also be categorized as absolute or relative:

- **Absolute URLs:** Provide the _complete_ address of the resource, including the scheme, domain name, and path.
  They are unambiguous and can be used from anywhere.
- **Relative URLs:** Specify the location of a resource _relative_ to the current page.
  For example, if you're on `https://www.example.com/about.html` and there's a link to `contact.html`, that's a relative URL.
  The browser infers the full URL as `https://www.example.com/contact.html`.
  Relative URLs are shorter and can make website maintenance easier.

There are also Protocol-relative URLs that start with `//`.
These take the actual protocol of the page.

## URL Encoding

Sometimes, URLs need to include characters that are not allowed in their raw form (like spaces or special characters).
In these cases, **URL encoding** (also called percent-encoding) is used.
This replaces the unsafe characters with a percent sign (`%`) followed by a two-digit hexadecimal code.
For example, a space is encoded as `%20`.
