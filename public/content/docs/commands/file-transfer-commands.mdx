# ðŸš€ File Transfer Shenanigans (aka Teleportation)

Moving files between computers is a fundamental skill for any Linux user. Whether you're backing up important documents, sharing files with colleagues, or managing remote servers, knowing how to efficiently transfer files is essential. This guide covers various methods from the traditional to the magical.

## ðŸ“¦ SCP: Secure Copy Protocol

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a simple and secure way to transfer files between computers using SSH encryption.

### Basic Usage

#### Send Files to a Remote Machine

```bash
scp file.txt user@ip:/home/user/Desktop
```

This command copies `file.txt` from your local machine to the Desktop folder of the remote machine.

#### Copy Multiple Files

```bash
scp file1.txt file2.txt user@ip:/home/user/Documents/
```

#### Copy an Entire Directory

```bash
scp -r directory/ user@ip:/home/user/backup/
```

The `-r` flag enables recursive copying of directories.

#### Pull Files from a Remote Machine

```bash
scp user@ip:/var/log/syslog ./logs/
```

This fetches the syslog file from the remote server and saves it to your local `logs` directory.

#### Specify a Different Port

```bash
scp -P 2222 file.txt user@ip:/home/user/
```

Use the `-P` flag to specify a non-standard SSH port.

#### Copy with Compression

```bash
scp -C large_file.tar.gz user@ip:/home/user/
```

The `-C` flag enables compression during transfer, which can speed things up for text-based files.

#### Copy Between Two Remote Hosts

```bash
scp user1@host1:/path/to/file user2@host2:/path/to/destination
```

This copies files directly between two remote hosts without passing through your local machine.

## ðŸš€ rsync: Remote Sync

rsync is a powerful utility that synchronizes files and directories between two locations, transferring only the differences between the source and destination.

### Basic Usage

#### Sync a Directory to a Remote Machine

```bash
rsync -avz project/ user@ip:/home/user/backup_project/
```

This syncs the `project` directory to the remote machine with these options:
- `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.)
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-z`: Compress data during transfer

#### Sync from Remote to Local

```bash
rsync -avz user@ip:/home/user/project/ ./local_project/
```

#### Dry Run (Preview Changes)

```bash
rsync -avzn project/ user@ip:/home/user/backup_project/
```

The `-n` flag performs a dry run, showing what would be transferred without actually making changes.

#### Sync with Deletion

```bash
rsync -avz --delete project/ user@ip:/home/user/backup_project/
```

The `--delete` option removes files in the destination that don't exist in the source, creating a perfect mirror.

#### Exclude Files or Directories

```bash
rsync -avz --exclude='*.log' --exclude='node_modules' project/ user@ip:/home/user/backup_project/
```

#### Include Only Specific Files

```bash
rsync -avz --include='*.txt' --exclude='*' project/ user@ip:/home/user/backup_project/
```

This only syncs `.txt` files and excludes everything else.

#### Resume Interrupted Transfers

```bash
rsync -avzP large_file.iso user@ip:/home/user/
```

The `-P` flag combines `--partial` and `--progress`, allowing you to resume interrupted transfers and see progress.

#### Bandwidth Limiting

```bash
rsync -avz --bwlimit=1000 large_file.iso user@ip:/home/user/
```

This limits the bandwidth to 1000 KB/s.

## ðŸ§™ Creative File Transfer Techniques

### Send Text Directly to a File

```bash
echo "ðŸ‘‹ Hello from the void" | ssh user@ip "cat > ~/Desktop/hello.txt"
```

This creates a file with your message directly on the remote machine's desktop.

### Create and Send a Tarball in One Command

```bash
tar czf - directory/ | ssh user@ip "cat > ~/backup.tar.gz"
```

This compresses a directory and sends it to the remote machine without creating an intermediate file.

### Stream a File Through SSH

```bash
cat large_file.mp4 | ssh user@ip "cat > ~/videos/movie.mp4"
```

### Remote File Editing

```bash
vim scp://user@ip//path/to/file
```

This opens a remote file directly in vim for editing.

### Transfer a Disk Image

```bash
dd if=/dev/sda | ssh user@ip "dd of=/path/to/backup.img"
```

This creates a disk image and transfers it to the remote machine.

## ðŸ“¡ Alternative File Transfer Methods

### SFTP: SSH File Transfer Protocol

SFTP provides a more interactive file transfer experience with an FTP-like interface.

```bash
sftp user@ip
```

Once connected, you can use commands like:
- `put file.txt`: Upload a file
- `get file.txt`: Download a file
- `ls`: List remote files
- `cd`: Change remote directory
- `lcd`: Change local directory
- `mkdir`: Create remote directory

### nc (netcat): The Swiss Army Knife

Netcat can be used for quick file transfers between machines.

#### Receiving Side (Start First)

```bash
nc -l -p 1234 > received_file.txt
```

#### Sending Side

```bash
nc receiver_ip 1234 < file_to_send.txt
```

### Python HTTP Server

For quick and easy file sharing on a local network:

```bash
# On the sending machine
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then on the receiving machine, open a web browser to `http://sender_ip:8000` and download the files.

### Magic-Wormhole: Secure File Transfer with a Code

Magic-Wormhole is a modern tool that makes secure file transfers easy with a simple code.

```bash
# Install
pip install magic-wormhole

# Send a file
wormhole send important_file.pdf
# It will output a code like "7-coconut-pineapple"

# Receive a file (on another computer)
wormhole receive 7-coconut-pineapple
```

### croc: Simple, Secure, and Fast File Transfers

croc is a modern file transfer tool that's easy to use and secure.

```bash
# Install
curl https://getcroc.schollz.com | bash

# Send a file
croc send file.txt
# It will generate a code to share

# Receive a file
croc code-phrase-generated
```

## ðŸ”¥ Advanced Techniques

### Create a Persistent Reverse Tunnel for File Transfers

```bash
# On the remote machine (behind a firewall)
ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 user@your_public_server -N

# On your local machine, to send files to the remote machine
scp -P 2222 file.txt user@your_public_server:/path/to/destination
```

This creates a tunnel through a public server to reach a machine behind a firewall.

### Synchronize a Website with rsync

```bash
rsync -avz --delete --exclude '.git' --exclude 'node_modules' ./website/ user@server:/var/www/html/
```

### Backup a Database and Transfer It

```bash
ssh user@db_server "mysqldump -u root -p database_name | gzip -9" > database_backup.sql.gz
```

### Parallel File Transfers with GNU Parallel

```bash
find large_directory -type f | parallel -j8 scp {} user@ip:/destination/{}
```

This transfers up to 8 files simultaneously.

### Bidirectional Sync with Unison

```bash
unison local_dir ssh://user@ip//path/to/remote_dir
```

Unison keeps two directories in sync, handling changes on both sides.

## ðŸš¨ Security Considerations

1. **Use SSH Keys**: Avoid password authentication for file transfers
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519
   ssh-copy-id user@ip
   ```

2. **Encrypt Sensitive Files Before Transfer**:
   ```bash
   # Encrypt
   gpg -c sensitive_file.txt
   # Transfer the encrypted file
   scp sensitive_file.txt.gpg user@ip:/destination/
   # Decrypt on the other side
   gpg sensitive_file.txt.gpg
   ```

3. **Verify File Integrity**:
   ```bash
   # Generate checksum before transfer
   sha256sum file.txt > file.txt.sha256
   # Transfer both files
   scp file.txt file.txt.sha256 user@ip:/destination/
   # Verify on the destination
   cd /destination && sha256sum -c file.txt.sha256
   ```

## ðŸŽ­ Fun File Transfer Pranks (Use Responsibly!)

### Send a Self-Extracting Message

```bash
echo 'echo "BOO! ðŸ‘»" && sleep 1 && echo "Just kidding! ðŸ˜„"' | ssh user@ip "cat > ~/surprise.sh && chmod +x ~/surprise.sh"
```

Then tell your friend to run `./surprise.sh`.

### Remote Rickroll

```bash
ssh user@ip "wget -q -O - https://bit.ly/3sWVb8a | bash"
```

This plays "Never Gonna Give You Up" on the remote machine (requires speakers and a media player).

### Gradually Growing File

```bash
ssh user@ip "echo 'while true; do echo \"I am growing...\" >> ~/growing.txt; sleep 60; done' > ~/grow.sh && nohup bash ~/grow.sh &"
```

Creates a file that grows by one line every minute.
