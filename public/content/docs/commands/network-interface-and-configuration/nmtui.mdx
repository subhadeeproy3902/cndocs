# NMTUI Command in Linux

## Introduction

The `nmtui` (NetworkManager Text User Interface) command provides a simple, text-based user interface for managing network connections in Linux systems. It serves as an alternative to both the command-line `nmcli` tool and graphical network management interfaces, offering a middle ground that combines ease of use with terminal-based operation.

`nmtui` is particularly valuable in environments where a graphical interface is unavailable or undesirable, such as server installations, minimal desktop environments, or remote SSH sessions. It provides an intuitive, menu-driven interface for common network configuration tasks.

### What is IP Networking?

IP (Internet Protocol) networking refers to the process of setting up and managing IP addresses to enable communication between devices on a network. Proper IP configuration is essential for effective data exchange and is one of the foundational elements of any operating system. IP networking is used in both modern internet and local area networks (LANs), assigning unique addresses to devices for data transmission.

#### Key Components of IP Networking:

- **IP Address**: A numerical value assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves for both host identification and location addressing.
- **Subnetting**: The practice of dividing an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance and security, making large networks more manageable.
- **Routing**: The process of directing data between different networks, determining the optimal path for data packets to travel from source to destination.
- **Protocols**: Rules that govern communication within an IP network, including the Internet Protocol itself, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

## Basic Usage

To launch the NetworkManager Text User Interface, simply run:

```bash
nmtui
```

This command opens the main menu of the text-based interface, which typically offers the following options:

1. **Edit a connection** - Modify existing network connections or create new ones
2. **Activate a connection** - Enable or disable network connections
3. **Set system hostname** - Change the system's hostname

You can navigate through the interface using:
- Arrow keys to move between options
- Tab key to move between sections
- Enter key to select an option
- Esc key to go back or cancel

## Key Features and Functionality
