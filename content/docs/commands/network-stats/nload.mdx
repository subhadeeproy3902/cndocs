# nload Command

## Introduction

`nload` is a console-based network monitoring utility that displays the current network traffic usage in real time. Unlike more complex tools that break down traffic by connection or process, nload focuses on providing a simple, clear visualization of the total incoming and outgoing bandwidth on network interfaces.

The tool presents network traffic using easy-to-read graphs and provides additional statistics such as total transferred data, min/max/average bandwidth usage, and more. This makes nload particularly useful for quickly assessing network performance and identifying bandwidth issues without the complexity of more detailed analysis tools.

nload is designed with simplicity in mind, making it ideal for:
- System administrators who need to quickly check network utilization
- Users troubleshooting network performance issues
- Server monitoring in environments where graphical tools aren't available
- Quick verification of bandwidth usage during network operations

## Installation

nload is available in the standard repositories of most Linux distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nload
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora Systems

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL with EPEL repository enabled
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install nload

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install nload
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S nload
```

### From Source

If nload is not available in your distribution's repositories, you can compile it from source:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential ncurses-dev

# Download source
wget http://www.roland-riegel.de/nload/nload-0.7.4.tar.gz

# Extract and compile
tar -xzf nload-0.7.4.tar.gz
cd nload-0.7.4
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Basic Usage

To start nload with default settings, simply run:

```bash
nload
```

Unlike some other network monitoring tools, nload doesn't require root privileges for basic functionality.

### Monitoring Specific Interfaces

By default, nload displays the first available network interface. To specify a particular interface:

```bash
nload eth0  # Monitor the eth0 interface
```

To monitor multiple interfaces, you can specify them as additional arguments:

```bash
nload eth0 wlan0  # Monitor both eth0 and wlan0
```

When monitoring multiple interfaces, you can switch between them using the left and right arrow keys.

## Understanding the Display

The nload display consists of two main sections for each network interface:

### Incoming Traffic (Top Section)

- **Graph**: Visual representation of incoming bandwidth usage over time
- **Current**: Current incoming bandwidth
- **Average**: Average incoming bandwidth since nload started
- **Min/Max**: Minimum and maximum incoming bandwidth observed
- **Total**: Total amount of data received since nload started

### Outgoing Traffic (Bottom Section)

- **Graph**: Visual representation of outgoing bandwidth usage over time
- **Current**: Current outgoing bandwidth
- **Average**: Average outgoing bandwidth since nload started
- **Min/Max**: Minimum and maximum outgoing bandwidth observed
- **Total**: Total amount of data sent since nload started

### Status Bar

At the bottom of the screen, nload displays:
- The currently displayed device
- Total number of devices being monitored
- Navigation hints

## Command-Line Options

nload offers several command-line options to customize its behavior:

### Display Options

```bash
# Set the refresh interval to 500 milliseconds (default is 500)
nload -t 500

# Set the number of data points in the traffic graphs to 20 (default is 60)
nload -a 20

# Set the scaling factor for the traffic graphs (default is 0)
nload -i 10

# Set the maximum bandwidth for the traffic graphs (in Kbit/s)
nload -m 10000

# Show multiple interfaces in multiple windows
nload -m devices
```

### Unit Options

```bash
# Display traffic in bits per second (default)
nload -u b

# Display traffic in bytes per second
nload -u B

# Display traffic in kilobits per second
nload -u k

# Display traffic in kilobytes per second
nload -u K

# Display traffic in megabits per second
nload -u m

# Display traffic in megabytes per second
nload -u M

# Display traffic in gigabits per second
nload -u g

# Display traffic in gigabytes per second
nload -u G
```

### Output Format

```bash
# Set the number of digits after the decimal point (default is 2)
nload -o 1
```

## Interactive Commands

While nload is running, you can use various keyboard commands to control the display:

### Navigation

- `Left Arrow` or `h`: Switch to the previous network device
- `Right Arrow` or `l`: Switch to the next network device
- `F5` or `r`: Refresh the display immediately
- `F6`: Cycle through the available units (bit/s, byte/s, etc.)
- `q`: Quit nload

### Display Settings

- `F2`: Decrease the refresh interval
- `F3`: Increase the refresh interval
- `F4`: Change the number of data points in the traffic graphs

## Practical Examples

### Basic Monitoring

To monitor the default network interface:

```bash
nload
```

### Monitoring Multiple Interfaces

To monitor both wired and wireless interfaces:

```bash
nload eth0 wlan0
```

### Custom Refresh Rate

For more responsive updates (200ms refresh):

```bash
nload -t 200
```

### Fixed Scale Graph

To set a fixed maximum scale for the graph (useful for consistent visualization):

```bash
nload -m 100000  # Set max scale to 100 Mbit/s
```

### Bytes Instead of Bits

To display traffic in bytes per second instead of bits:

```bash
nload -u B
```

### Combining Options

You can combine multiple options for customized monitoring:

```bash
nload -t 100 -a 100 -m 10000 -u M eth0
```

This sets a 100ms refresh rate, 100 data points in the graph, a maximum scale of 10,000 Kbit/s, and displays traffic in megabytes per second for the eth0 interface.

## Advanced Usage

### Using nload in Scripts

While nload is primarily an interactive tool, you can use it in non-interactive mode to get a snapshot of current network usage:

```bash
nload -n eth0
```

This will display a single update and exit, which can be useful for scripting.

### Continuous Monitoring with Logging

To log network usage over time, you can combine nload with other tools:

```bash
# Log network usage every 5 seconds
while true; do nload eth0 -n | grep "Curr" >> network_log.txt; sleep 5; done
```

### Monitoring Remote Systems

You can use nload over SSH to monitor remote systems:

```bash
ssh user@remote_server 'nload'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Device not found"

This occurs when specifying a non-existent interface:

```
Solution: Use 'ip a' to list available interfaces, then use the correct interface name
```

#### Low Resolution Graphs

If the graphs appear too compressed or lack detail:

```
Solution: Increase the number of data points with -a option
```

#### Inaccurate Readings

If readings seem inaccurate or inconsistent:

```
Solution: Ensure no other bandwidth-intensive processes are running in the background
```
