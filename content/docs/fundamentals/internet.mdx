You're probably reading this _using_ the internet, but what exactly _is_ it? It's not just websites (that's the _Web_, which we'll cover later).
Think of the internet as the basic system that makes all the online stuff you do possible.

## What is the Internet? The Big Picture

Imagine the most extensive, complex network of roads imaginable.
The internet is similar, but instead of cars traveling those roads, we have information flowing between all sorts of devices.
It's a gigantic, global network that links computers (desktops, laptops, and powerful servers that store websites), mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), and even many "smart" gadgets like TVs, game consoles, and appliances.
All these devices are connected, allowing them to communicate and share data.

## The Key Ingredients

### Connections

To make this global communication work, the internet relies on three key ingredients. First, we need the connections - the "roads" that data travels on.
These connections come in two main forms.
These connections come in two main forms: physical cables and wireless signals. Physical cables, like fiber optic, use light to send data super fast.
These cables span continents and even lie beneath the oceans. Then, there are wireless signals, like the Wi-Fi in your home or the cellular network that connects your phone.
These use radio waves to send information through the air.

### Addressing

The second crucial ingredient is the addressing system. Every device connected to the internet needs a unique identifier, just like every house has a unique street address.
This identifier is called an IP address. There are two main types of IP addresses.
The older type, IPv4, looks like a series of four numbers, such as `192.168.1.1`.
Despite the rise of IPv6, IPv4 remains critically important, especially for servers and core internet infrastructure.
We're actually running out of IPv4 addresses due to the vast number of devices online!
The newer type, IPv6, is much longer and more complex, looking something like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
IPv6 provides an enormous number of addresses, making it suitable for assigning to less critical devices like smartphones or smart TVs.
These IP addresses act like the "house numbers" for devices, letting the network know where to deliver information.

### Protocols

Finally, we have the rules that govern how all these devices communicate - the protocols known as TCP/IP.
Think of TCP/IP as the traffic laws of the internet. TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is like a highly reliable delivery service.
It breaks down information into small packets, ensures they arrive in the correct sequence, checks for errors, and requests re-sends if anything is missing.
It's all about ensuring dependable delivery. IP, or Internet Protocol, is like the postal worker who understands the routes.
It takes those packets and determines the optimal path to send them to the correct IP address, handling the routing of information across the network.

To visualize this, imagine sending a long letter to a friend across the country.
TCP would be like dividing the letter into numbered pages, placing them in envelopes, and adding a return address.
IP would be like writing your friend's address on each envelope and dropping them in the mailbox.
The postal system, representing the internet itself, carries the envelopes along various routes.
At your friend's end, IP delivers the envelopes to the right address, and TCP ensures your friend reassembles the pages in order, confirming none are missing.

## It's NOT Just Websites!

It's important to know that the internet is more than just websites.
Websites are part of something called the World Wide Web, which uses the internet.
The internet also makes email, online games, video calls, and many other things work.
Think of the internet as the base, and everything else, like websites, sits on top of it.
