# Bluetooth Technology

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances using radio waves in the ISM band from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz, from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it has evolved into a ubiquitous technology found in billions of devices worldwide.

## What is Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is a standardized protocol for sending and receiving data via a 2.4GHz wireless link. It's designed to connect devices wirelessly over a short range, typically less than 100 meters, with minimal power consumption.

The name "Bluetooth" comes from Harald Bluetooth, a 10th-century Danish king who united dissonant Danish tribes into a single kingdom. The technology was named after him as it was intended to unite different devices.

## How Bluetooth Works

Bluetooth operates using a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum:

### Frequency Hopping

- Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets
- Transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels
- Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz
- The protocol switches channels up to 1600 times per second
- This helps reduce interference and provides basic security

### Network Topology

Bluetooth devices connect to each other forming a network known as a piconet:

- A piconet can contain up to 8 active devices (1 master and up to 7 slaves)
- The master device controls the timing and frequency hopping sequence
- Multiple piconets can be linked to form a scatternet
- Devices can participate in multiple piconets simultaneously

## Bluetooth Protocol Stack

The Bluetooth protocol stack consists of several layers:

### Core Protocols

1. **Baseband**: Handles physical channel management, links, packets, error detection
2. **Link Manager Protocol (LMP)**: Manages link setup, security, and control
3. **Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)**: Multiplexes data, segments packets, quality of service
4. **Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)**: Allows devices to discover services offered by other devices

### Cable Replacement Protocols

1. **RFCOMM**: Serial port emulation, provides a simple reliable data stream
2. **BNEP**: Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol, used for IP networking over Bluetooth

### Adopted Protocols

1. **OBEX**: Object Exchange, used for file transfers
2. **TCS**: Telephony Control Protocol, for call control signaling
3. **AT Commands**: For modem control

### Application Profiles

Bluetooth profiles define how applications use Bluetooth. Common profiles include:

- **A2DP**: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile for streaming audio
- **AVRCP**: Audio/Video Remote Control Profile
- **HFP**: Hands-Free Profile for car kits and headsets
- **HSP**: Headset Profile for headsets
- **HID**: Human Interface Device for keyboards, mice, etc.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Profile
- **PAN**: Personal Area Networking
