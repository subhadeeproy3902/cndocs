# What is DNS?

DNS is a hierarchical and distributed system that translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into the numerical IP addresses (like `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to identify each other on the internet.
It's like a giant, global directory service.

Without DNS, you'd have to remember and type in the IP address of every website you wanted to visit.
Imagine trying to remember `172.217.160.142` instead of `google.com`! DNS makes the internet much more user-friendly.

## How DNS Works: The Lookup Process

When you type a domain name into your browser, here's a simplified overview of what happens behind the scenes:

1.  **The Request:** Your browser (the client) needs to find the IP address associated with the domain name.
    It starts by asking a **DNS resolver**.
    Often, your internet service provider (ISP) provides a DNS resolver, but you can also use public resolvers like Google Public DNS or Cloudflare DNS.
2.  **Recursive Query:** The DNS resolver doesn't usually know the IP address offhand.
    It starts a _recursive query_, meaning it will ask other DNS servers until it finds the answer.
3.  **Root Servers:** The resolver first contacts one of the **root name servers**.
    There are 13 sets of root servers around the world, and they are the top of the DNS hierarchy.
    They don't know the IP address of `example.com`, but they know which servers are responsible for the `.com` top-level domain (TLD).
4.  **TLD Servers:** The root server directs the resolver to a **TLD (Top-Level Domain) name server**.
    TLD servers are responsible for specific domain extensions like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, etc.
    The TLD server for `.com` doesn't know the IP address of `www.example.com`, but it knows which servers are responsible for the `example.com` domain.
5.  **Authoritative Name Servers:** The TLD server directs the resolver to an **authoritative name server** for the specific domain (`example.com` in our example).
    These servers are maintained by the domain name registrar (the company where the domain name was registered) or the website owner.
    The authoritative name server _does_ know the IP address associated with `www.example.com`.
6.  **The Answer:** The authoritative name server sends the IP address back to the DNS resolver.
7.  **Caching:** The DNS resolver _caches_ (stores) the IP address for a certain period (determined by the "Time to Live" or TTL value).
    This speeds up future lookups for the same domain name.
8.  **Response to Client:** The DNS resolver sends the IP address to your browser.
9.  **Connection:** Your browser now has the IP address and can connect directly to the web server hosting `www.example.com` to request the web page.

This entire process, involving multiple DNS servers, usually happens in milliseconds.

## The DNS Hierarchy

DNS is organized in a hierarchical structure, like an upside-down tree:

- **Root:** At the top are the root name servers.
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs):** Below the root are TLDs, such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`, `.gov`, and country-code TLDs like `.uk`, `.ca`, `.jp`.
- **Second-Level Domains:** These are the domains that you register, like `example` in `example.com`.
- **Subdomains:** These are further divisions within a domain, like `www` in `www.example.com` or `blog` in `blog.example.com`.

This hierarchical structure allows DNS to be distributed and managed efficiently.
No single server needs to know all the IP addresses for every domain name on the internet.

## DNS Records

DNS servers store information about domain names in **DNS records**.
There are many different types of DNS records, each serving a specific purpose.
Some of the most common include:

- **A Record (Address Record):** Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
  This is the most common type of record, used for finding the IP address of a website.
- **AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record):** Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):** Creates an alias for a domain name.
  For example, `www.example.com` might be a CNAME record pointing to `example.com`.
- **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record):** Specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email messages for a domain.
- **TXT Record (Text Record):** Stores text-based information about a domain.
  Often used for verification purposes or for storing additional data.
- **NS Record (Name Server Record):** Specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain.
