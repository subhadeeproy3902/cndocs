# route Command

## Introduction

The `route` command is a traditional Linux networking utility used to view and manipulate the IP routing table. It allows system administrators to configure static routes, set up default gateways, and manage how network packets are forwarded between different networks and interfaces.

The routing table acts as a map that determines the path network packets take to reach their destination. By using the `route` command, administrators can control network traffic flow, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and optimize network performance.

While the `route` command is still widely used, it's considered a legacy tool from the `net-tools` package. Modern Linux distributions are gradually transitioning to the more powerful and versatile `ip route` command from the `iproute2` package. However, many system administrators still prefer `route` for its simplicity and familiarity.

## Installation

The `route` command is part of the `net-tools` package, which may not be installed by default on newer Linux distributions. To install it:

### Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install net-tools
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora Systems

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install net-tools

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install net-tools
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S net-tools
```

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the route command is:

```bash
route [options] [command] [destination] [gateway] [netmask] [metric] [dev interface]
```

Where:
- **options**: Various flags that modify the behavior of the command
- **command**: The action to perform (add, del, etc.)
- **destination**: The destination network or host
- **gateway**: The gateway address for the route
- **netmask**: The network mask for the destination
- **metric**: The metric value for the route (priority)
- **dev interface**: The network interface to use

## Basic Usage

### Displaying the Routing Table

To display the current routing table:

```bash
route
```

This shows the routing table with hostnames and network names resolved.

### Displaying the Routing Table in Numeric Format

To display the routing table with IP addresses instead of hostnames:

```bash
route -n
```

This is useful when DNS resolution is slow or unavailable, or when you need to see the actual IP addresses.

## Understanding the Output

The output of the `route` command includes several columns:

- **Destination**: The destination network or host
- **Gateway**: The gateway address (an asterisk indicates no gateway is needed)
- **Genmask**: The netmask for the destination
- **Flags**: Various routing flags
  - **U**: Route is up
  - **G**: Route uses a gateway
  - **H**: Target is a host (not a network)
  - **!**: Reject route
- **Metric**: The distance to the target (lower is preferred)
- **Ref**: Number of references to this route
- **Use**: Count of lookups for the route
- **Iface**: The interface to which packets for this route will be sent

## Advanced Usage

### Adding a Default Gateway

To add a default gateway (the router that handles traffic for destinations not explicitly listed in the routing table):

```bash
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1
```

Replace `192.168.1.1` with your router's IP address.

### Deleting the Default Gateway

To remove the default gateway:

```bash
sudo route del default
```

**Caution**: This may disconnect you from networks outside your local subnet.

### Adding a Static Route

To add a static route to a specific network:

```bash
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254
```

This routes traffic for the 10.0.0.0/24 network through the gateway at 192.168.1.254.

### Adding a Host Route

To add a route to a specific host:

```bash
sudo route add -host 10.0.0.1 gw 192.168.1.254
```

This routes traffic for the specific host 10.0.0.1 through the gateway at 192.168.1.254.

### Specifying an Interface for a Route

To add a route that uses a specific network interface:

```bash
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
```

This routes traffic for the 10.0.0.0/24 network through the eth0 interface.

### Rejecting Traffic to a Host or Network

To create a route that rejects traffic to a specific host:

```bash
sudo route add -host 192.168.1.51 reject
```

This causes the system to respond with "Network is unreachable" when attempting to communicate with 192.168.1.51.

### Displaying the Kernel's Routing Cache

To display the kernel's routing cache (if available):

```bash
route -Cn
```

The routing cache helps speed up routing decisions by caching recent lookups.

## Practical Examples

### Setting Up Multiple Network Interfaces

If your system has multiple network interfaces connected to different networks:

```bash
# Configure the first interface
sudo route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0

# Configure the second interface
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1

# Set default gateway through eth0
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

### Creating a Static Route to a Remote Network

To access a remote network through a specific gateway:

```bash
sudo route add -net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.1.254
```

This allows your system to reach the 172.16.0.0/16 network through the gateway at 192.168.1.254.

### Troubleshooting Network Connectivity

If you're having trouble reaching a specific network:

```bash
# Check the current routing table
route -n

# Add a specific route if needed
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254

# Test connectivity
ping 10.0.0.1
```

### Setting Up a Router

To configure a Linux system as a router between two networks:

```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Configure routes for each network
sudo route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth1
```

## Making Routes Persistent

Routes added with the `route` command are not persistent and will be lost after a system reboot. To make routes persistent, you need to configure them in your distribution's network configuration files.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Edit the interfaces file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following lines:

```
# For a static route
up route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254

# For a default gateway
up route add default gw 192.168.1.1
```

### Red Hat/CentOS

Create a route configuration file for each interface:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0
```

Add the following lines:

```
10.0.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.254 dev eth0
```

### Using netplan (Ubuntu 18.04+)

Edit your netplan configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

Add routes to the configuration:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      routes:
        - to: 10.0.0.0/24
          via: 192.168.1.254
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

## Comparison with ip route

The `ip route` command from the `iproute2` package is the modern replacement for `route`. Here's a comparison of common commands:

| Task | route Command | ip route Command |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Show routing table | `route -n` | `ip route` |
| Add default gateway | `route add default gw 192.168.1.1` | `ip route add default via 192.168.1.1` |
| Delete default gateway | `route del default` | `ip route del default` |
| Add network route | `route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254` | `ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.254` |
| Add host route | `route add -host 10.0.0.1 gw 192.168.1.254` | `ip route add 10.0.0.1/32 via 192.168.1.254` |
| Delete route | `route del -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0` | `ip route del 10.0.0.0/24` |
| Show local routes | Not directly available | `ip route show table local` |

### Advantages of ip route over route

- More consistent syntax
- Support for advanced routing features (policy routing, multiple routing tables)
- Better support for IPv6
- More detailed output options
- Active development and maintenance

## Common Options Reference

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-n` | Display numerical addresses instead of trying to resolve hostnames |
| `-e` | Display the routing table in a more verbose format |
| `-F` | Display the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) |
| `-C` | Display the routing cache instead of the FIB |
| `-v` | Select verbose operation |
| `-A family` | Use the specified address family (inet, inet6) |
| `-net` | The target is a network |
| `-host` | The target is a host |
| `reject` | Set up a blocking route |
| `mod`, `del`, `add` | Modify, delete or add a route |
| `dev interface` | Force the route to be associated with the specified device |
| `netmask mask` | Specify the netmask |
| `gw gateway` | Route packets via a gateway |
| `metric M` | Set the metric field in the routing table |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable"

This error occurs when you try to add a route through a gateway that's not directly reachable:

```
Solution: Ensure the gateway is on a directly connected network
```

#### "SIOCADDRT: File exists"

This error occurs when you try to add a route that already exists:

```
Solution: Delete the existing route first or modify it instead of adding a new one
```

#### Routes Not Working After Reboot

Routes added with the `route` command are not persistent:

```
Solution: Configure routes in your distribution's network configuration files
```

#### Unable to Reach Specific Networks

If you can't reach certain networks despite having routes configured:

```
Solution: Check for firewall rules that might be blocking traffic
```

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Routes**: Only add routes that are necessary for your network topology
2. **Use Reject Routes**: Use reject routes to explicitly block traffic to sensitive networks
3. **Consider Firewall Rules**: Remember that routing and firewalling work together to control traffic flow

### Performance Optimization

1. **Minimize Route Lookups**: Keep your routing table as simple as possible
2. **Use Metrics Wisely**: Set appropriate metrics to ensure traffic takes the optimal path
3. **Consider Route Caching**: On high-traffic systems, ensure the routing cache is properly sized

### Documentation

1. **Document Your Routes**: Keep documentation of your routing configuration
2. **Use Comments**: Add comments in configuration files explaining the purpose of each route
3. **Create Network Diagrams**: Maintain network diagrams showing how routes connect different networks

## Conclusion

The `route` command is a fundamental tool for managing network routing in Linux systems. While it's gradually being replaced by the more powerful `ip route` command, it remains widely used due to its simplicity and familiarity.

Understanding how to use `route` to view and manipulate the routing table is essential for network administrators, as it allows them to control how traffic flows through their networks, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and optimize network performance.

For modern Linux systems, it's recommended to learn both the traditional `route` command and its successor `ip route`, as you're likely to encounter both in various environments. The `ip route` command offers more features and better support for modern networking requirements, but the `route` command's straightforward syntax makes it valuable for quick checks and basic configuration tasks.
