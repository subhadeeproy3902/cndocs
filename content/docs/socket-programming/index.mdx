# What is Socket Programming?

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP address, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.

Socket programming is the foundation of most network communication and is widely used in:
- Web servers and browsers
- Email clients and servers
- Instant messaging applications
- File transfer protocols
- Online gaming
- Distributed systems
- IoT device communication
