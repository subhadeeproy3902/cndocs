# iftop Command

## Introduction

`iftop` is a free and open-source command-line system monitoring utility that displays a frequently-updated list of network bandwidth usage broken down by individual host connections. Unlike other bandwidth monitoring tools that show bandwidth usage by process or interface, iftop focuses on showing the bandwidth consumed by individual TCP/IP connections.

The name "iftop" is derived from "interface top," similar to how the popular "top" command displays process activity. Just as "top" provides real-time information about processes, iftop provides real-time information about network connections.

iftop is particularly useful for network administrators and system engineers who need to:
- Identify which connections are consuming the most bandwidth
- Monitor network usage patterns in real-time
- Troubleshoot network congestion issues
- Detect unusual network activity

## Installation

iftop is not typically installed by default on most Linux distributions, but it's available in the standard repositories.

### Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iftop
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora Systems

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL with EPEL repository enabled
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install iftop

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install iftop
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S iftop
```

### From Source

If iftop is not available in your distribution's repositories, you can compile it from source:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev libncurses5-dev

# Download source
wget http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/download/iftop-0.17.tar.gz

# Extract and compile
tar -zxvf iftop-0.17.tar.gz
cd iftop-0.17
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Basic Usage

To start iftop with default settings, simply run:

```bash
sudo iftop
```

Root privileges (sudo) are required because iftop needs to put the network interface into promiscuous mode to capture packets.

### Specifying a Network Interface

By default, iftop monitors the first available network interface. To specify a particular interface, use the `-i` option:

```bash
sudo iftop -i eth0  # Monitor the eth0 interface
sudo iftop -i wlan0 # Monitor the wlan0 interface
```

### Understanding the Display

The iftop display consists of several sections:

1. **Header**: Shows the interface being monitored and the total bandwidth usage
2. **Connection List**: Shows individual connections sorted by bandwidth usage
3. **Statistics Bars**: Shows graphical representation of traffic over time
4. **Summary**: Shows cumulative bandwidth statistics
5. **Legend**: Shows the meaning of various symbols and abbreviations

#### Connection List Format

Each line in the connection list shows:

```
Source Host <=> Destination Host    TX    RX    TOTAL
```

Where:
- **Source Host**: The local or source IP address/hostname
- **Destination Host**: The remote or destination IP address/hostname
- **TX**: Data transmitted from source to destination
- **RX**: Data received from destination to source
- **TOTAL**: Total bandwidth (TX + RX)

#### Traffic Statistics

At the bottom of the display, iftop shows three rows of cumulative statistics:

1. **TX**: Total transmitted bandwidth
2. **RX**: Total received bandwidth
3. **TOTAL**: Combined bandwidth

Each row shows three values:
- **Last 2s**: Average over the last 2 seconds
- **Last 10s**: Average over the last 10 seconds
- **Last 40s**: Average over the last 40 seconds

## Advanced Options

### Filtering Traffic

iftop allows you to filter the displayed traffic using Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax, similar to tcpdump:

```bash
# Show only HTTP traffic
sudo iftop -f 'port 80 or port 443'

# Show traffic to/from a specific host
sudo iftop -f 'host 192.168.1.100'

# Show traffic between two specific subnets
sudo iftop -f 'net 192.168.1.0/24 and net 10.0.0.0/8'
```

### Display Options

iftop offers several options to customize the display:

```bash
# Don't show bar graphs
sudo iftop -b

# Show traffic in bytes rather than bits
sudo iftop -B

# Don't perform hostname lookups
sudo iftop -n

# Don't perform port lookups
sudo iftop -N

# Show port numbers
sudo iftop -P

# Sort by source address
sudo iftop -S

# Sort by destination address
sudo iftop -D
```

### Bandwidth Scale

By default, iftop automatically scales the bandwidth units. You can force specific units:

```bash
# Display bandwidth in bytes
sudo iftop -B

# Display bandwidth in bits
sudo iftop -b
```

### Packet Direction

You can filter traffic based on direction:

```bash
# Show only incoming traffic
sudo iftop -t

# Show only outgoing traffic
sudo iftop -s
```

## Interactive Commands

While iftop is running, you can use various keyboard commands to control the display:

### Display Controls

- `h`: Display help
- `q`: Quit iftop
- `p`: Pause the display
- `b`: Toggle the display of the bar graphs
- `B`: Toggle the display of bandwidth in bytes/bits
- `n`: Toggle hostname resolution
- `N`: Toggle port resolution
- `s`: Toggle display of source host
- `d`: Toggle display of destination host
- `t`: Cycle through the display modes (2-line, 1-line, and classic)

### Sorting Controls

- `o`: Cycle through the sort options
- `1`: Sort by first column (source/destination)
- `2`: Sort by second column (source/destination)
- `3`: Sort by third column (bandwidth)

### Filtering Controls

- `l`: Set a filter code (using BPF syntax)
- `L`: Clear the filter
- `f`: Edit the filter code

### Scrolling

- `j` or `↓`: Scroll down
- `k` or `↑`: Scroll up
- `Space`: Scroll down one page

## Practical Examples

### Monitoring Specific Interface Traffic

To monitor traffic on a specific network interface:

```bash
sudo iftop -i eth0
```

### Identifying Bandwidth-Heavy Services

To identify which services are consuming the most bandwidth:

```bash
sudo iftop -P
```

This shows port numbers, helping you identify the services.

### Monitoring Traffic to External Networks

To monitor traffic between your local network and the internet:

```bash
sudo iftop -f 'not src and dst net 192.168.0.0/16'
```

This filters out internal traffic within your local 192.168.0.0/16 network.

### Monitoring Specific Protocol Traffic

To monitor only HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```bash
sudo iftop -f 'tcp port 80 or tcp port 443'
```

### Detecting Unusual Network Activity

To detect potential data exfiltration or unusual connections:

```bash
sudo iftop -t -P
```

This shows outgoing connections with port numbers, helping identify unexpected outbound traffic.

### Monitoring DNS Traffic

To monitor DNS queries and responses:

```bash
sudo iftop -f 'udp port 53'
```

### Combining Multiple Options

You can combine multiple options for more specific monitoring:

```bash
sudo iftop -i eth0 -n -P -B -f 'not port 22'
```

This monitors the eth0 interface, doesn't resolve hostnames, shows port numbers, displays bandwidth in bytes, and excludes SSH traffic.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Error opening interface: Permission denied"

This occurs when running iftop without sufficient privileges:

```
Solution: Run iftop with sudo or as root
```

#### "Interface not found"

This happens when specifying a non-existent interface:

```
Solution: Use 'ip a' to list available interfaces, then use the correct interface name
```

#### "No suitable devices found"

This can occur when no network interfaces are available for monitoring:

```
Solution: Check network interface status with 'ip link'
```

#### High CPU Usage

iftop can consume significant CPU resources on busy networks:

```
Solution: Use more specific filters to reduce the amount of traffic being analyzed
```
