# CN Docs - The Best ever Networking Documentation

## üìö Overview

CN Docs is a comprehensive, well-structured documentation site for computer networking and socket programming. Built with Next.js and Fumadocs, it provides clear explanations, practical examples, and high-quality code samples for everything from networking fundamentals to advanced socket programming techniques.

### üåü Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From OSI model to advanced socket programming
- **High-Quality Code Examples**: Well-documented, production-ready code samples
- **Practical Projects**: Real-world networking applications and implementations
- **Clear Explanations**: Complex concepts broken down into digestible sections
- **Interactive UI**: Modern, responsive interface with excellent navigation
- **Structured Learning Path**: Logical progression from basics to advanced topics

## üß© Content Structure

The documentation is organized into logical sections:

### I. Foundational Concepts

- IP Addressing & DNS
- Internet Architecture
- TCP & UDP Protocols
- MAC Addressing
- URL Structure
- HTTP Protocol

### II. Socket Programming
- Socket Fundamentals
  - Socket Types
  - Socket API
  - Socket Options
  - Byte Order
  - Security Considerations
  - Best Practices
- Socket Models
  - TCP Sockets
  - UDP Sockets
  - Client-Server Architecture
  - Multicast Communication
  - Unix Domain Sockets
  - Raw Sockets
- Advanced Techniques
  - Blocking vs Non-blocking
  - Multiplexing (select/poll)
  - Advanced Multiplexing (epoll)
  - Socket I/O Techniques
  - Debugging Socket Applications
- Error Handling

### III. Code in Action
- Complete networking projects
- Example implementations
- Performance benchmarks

## üíª Code Examples

Each topic includes practical, well-commented code examples that demonstrate key concepts. Our examples:

- Follow best practices for production-ready code
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear comments explaining each step
- Are tested in real-world scenarios
- Include both basic and advanced implementations

Example from our Client-Server Architecture section:

```c
// Message header structure
struct message_header {
    uint8_t  version;       // Protocol version
    uint8_t  type;          // Message type
    uint16_t command;       // Command identifier
    uint32_t payload_size;  // Size of the payload
    uint32_t sequence_id;   // Message sequence number
};

// Complete message structure
struct message {
    struct message_header header;
    char payload[MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE];
};
```

## üìù Content Creation

### Adding New Documentation

We use a custom script to easily add content from sources like GeeksforGeeks:

```bash
bun run add-doc <url>
```

This automatically:
- Scrapes content from the provided URL
- Downloads images to the public folder
- Generates well-formatted MDX files
- Applies proper formatting and styling

### Manual Content Creation

1. Create a new MDX file in the appropriate directory under `content/docs/`
2. Add frontmatter with title and description
3. Write your content using Markdown and MDX components
4. Add code examples, images, and other resources as needed

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
