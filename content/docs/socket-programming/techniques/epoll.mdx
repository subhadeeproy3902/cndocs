# Advanced Multiplexing with epoll()

The `epoll` API is a Linux-specific I/O event notification facility that provides a more efficient way to monitor multiple file descriptors compared to `select()` and `poll()`. It's designed to scale well with a large number of file descriptors and is particularly useful for high-performance servers.

## Limitations of select() and poll()

Before diving into `epoll`, let's review why `select()` and `poll()` can be inefficient for large-scale applications:

1. **O(n) Scanning**: Both functions require scanning all monitored file descriptors to find which ones are ready
2. **Inefficient Data Transfer**: The entire set of file descriptors must be copied between user space and kernel space on each call
3. **Repeated Setup**: The set of monitored file descriptors must be rebuilt for each call
4. **Limited Scalability**: Performance degrades significantly with a large number of file descriptors

## The epoll API

The `epoll` API addresses these limitations by:

1. **Using a File Descriptor Set Object**: The set of monitored file descriptors is maintained by the kernel
2. **Providing Edge-Triggered Notifications**: Events can be delivered when state changes occur
3. **Returning Only Ready File Descriptors**: No need to scan all file descriptors
4. **Separating Monitoring Setup from Waiting**: The set of monitored file descriptors is set up once and can be modified as needed

The `epoll` API consists of three main functions:

### epoll_create()

Creates an epoll instance and returns a file descriptor referring to that instance.

```c
int epoll_create(int size);
int epoll_create1(int flags);  // Since Linux 2.6.27
```

**Parameters:**
- `size`: Hint about the number of file descriptors to be monitored (ignored since Linux 2.6.8)
- `flags`: Optional flags (EPOLL_CLOEXEC is the only valid flag)

**Returns:**
- A file descriptor referring to the new epoll instance on success
- -1 on error

### epoll_ctl()

Controls the epoll instance by adding, modifying, or removing file descriptors.

```c
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);
```

**Parameters:**
- `epfd`: The epoll file descriptor
- `op`: The operation to perform (EPOLL_CTL_ADD, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, EPOLL_CTL_DEL)
- `fd`: The file descriptor to operate on
- `event`: Describes the events to monitor and contains a user-defined data field

**Returns:**
- 0 on success
- -1 on error

### epoll_wait()

Waits for events on the epoll instance.

```c
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);
```

**Parameters:**
- `epfd`: The epoll file descriptor
- `events`: Array where the ready events are returned
- `maxevents`: Maximum number of events to return
- `timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds, -1 for infinite, 0 for immediate return

**Returns:**
- The number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O on success
- 0 if the timeout expired
- -1 on error

### epoll_event Structure

```c
struct epoll_event {
    uint32_t     events;    /* Epoll events */
    epoll_data_t data;      /* User data variable */
};

typedef union epoll_data {
    void    *ptr;
    int      fd;
    uint32_t u32;
    uint64_t u64;
} epoll_data_t;
```

**Common event flags:**
- `EPOLLIN`: The file descriptor is available for read operations
- `EPOLLOUT`: The file descriptor is available for write operations
- `EPOLLRDHUP`: Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection
- `EPOLLERR`: Error condition happened on the file descriptor
- `EPOLLHUP`: Hang up happened on the file descriptor
- `EPOLLET`: Edge-triggered behavior (instead of default level-triggered)
- `EPOLLONESHOT`: One-shot behavior (event reported only once, then removed from set)

## Level-Triggered vs Edge-Triggered

`epoll` supports two different modes of operation:

### Level-Triggered (LT)

- Default mode
- An event is reported as long as the condition is true
- Similar to how `select()` and `poll()` work
- More forgiving of programming errors
- May result in more system calls

### Edge-Triggered (ET)

- An event is reported only when the state changes
- Requires using non-blocking file descriptors
- More efficient (fewer system calls)
- More complex to program correctly
- Must read/write all available data until EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK

## Edge-Triggered Mode Best Practices

When using edge-triggered mode with `epoll`, follow these best practices to avoid common pitfalls:

1. **Always Use Non-blocking File Descriptors**: Edge-triggered mode requires non-blocking file descriptors to prevent blocking when reading/writing all available data
2. **Read/Write Until EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK**: In edge-triggered mode, you must read/write all available data until you get EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
3. **Handle Partial Reads/Writes**: Implement proper buffer management to handle partial reads and writes
4. **Be Careful with Blocking Operations**: Avoid other blocking operations that could prevent processing all available data
5. **Consider Using a Thread Pool**: For operations that might block, consider offloading them to a thread pool

## Using epoll with User Data

The `epoll_data_t` union allows you to associate user data with each file descriptor. This can be useful for storing context information:

```c
struct client_context {
    int fd;
    char *buffer;
    size_t buffer_size;
    size_t bytes_read;
    // Other client-specific data
};

// When adding a file descriptor to epoll
struct client_context *ctx = malloc(sizeof(struct client_context));
ctx->fd = client_fd;
ctx->buffer = malloc(BUFFER_SIZE);
ctx->buffer_size = BUFFER_SIZE;
ctx->bytes_read = 0;

struct epoll_event ev;
ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
ev.data.ptr = ctx;  // Store pointer to context
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, client_fd, &ev);

// When handling events
struct client_context *ctx = events[i].data.ptr;
int fd = ctx->fd;
```

## One-shot Events

The `EPOLLONESHOT` flag can be used to ensure that a file descriptor is reported only once, after which it is automatically disabled:

```c
// Add client socket to epoll with EPOLLONESHOT
ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT;
ev.data.fd = client_fd;
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, client_fd, &ev);

// After handling the event, re-arm the file descriptor if needed
ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT;
ev.data.fd = fd;
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, &ev);
```

This is useful in multi-threaded applications to ensure that only one thread processes events for a given file descriptor at a time.

## Monitoring for Write Readiness

To monitor when a file descriptor is ready for writing, use the `EPOLLOUT` flag:

```c
// Add client socket to epoll with EPOLLOUT
ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT | EPOLLET;
ev.data.fd = client_fd;
epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, client_fd, &ev);

// When handling events
if (events[i].events & EPOLLOUT) {
    // Socket is ready for writing
    // ...
}
```

This is useful when implementing asynchronous write operations or when dealing with non-blocking connects.

## Comparison with Other Multiplexing APIs

| Feature | select() | poll() | epoll() | kqueue() (BSD) | IOCP (Windows) |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Scalability | Poor | Moderate | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| Portability | Very High | High | Linux only | BSD/macOS only | Windows only |
| Event Model | Level-triggered | Level-triggered | Both LT and ET | Both LT and ET | Completion-based |
| API Complexity | Low | Low | Moderate | Moderate | High |
| Performance with Many FDs | Poor | Poor | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| Memory Usage | High | Moderate | Low | Low | Low |

## When to Use epoll()

`epoll()` is particularly well-suited for:

1. **High-Performance Servers**: Handling thousands or even millions of connections
2. **Long-Lived Connections**: Applications with connections that remain open for extended periods
3. **Linux-Based Systems**: When portability to non-Linux systems is not a requirement
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Applications built around an event loop

## Limitations of epoll()

Despite its advantages, `epoll()` has some limitations:

1. **Linux-Specific**: Not portable to other operating systems
2. **Learning Curve**: More complex API compared to `select()` and `poll()`
3. **Edge-Triggered Complexity**: Edge-triggered mode requires careful programming
4. **Regular Files Not Supported**: `epoll()` does not work with regular files, only with certain types of file descriptors (sockets, pipes, etc.)

## Conclusion

The `epoll` API provides a high-performance solution for multiplexing I/O on Linux systems. By addressing the limitations of `select()` and `poll()`, it enables the development of scalable server applications capable of handling thousands or even millions of concurrent connections.

While `epoll()` has a steeper learning curve than `select()` and `poll()`, its performance benefits make it the preferred choice for high-performance Linux servers. For cross-platform applications, consider using a library that abstracts the differences between `epoll()`, `kqueue()`, and IOCP, such as libuv or Boost.Asio.

In the next section, we'll explore socket I/O techniques, including asynchronous I/O and scatter-gather operations, which can further improve the performance and flexibility of socket applications.
