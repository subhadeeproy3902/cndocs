# Wget Command in Linux

## Introduction

The `wget` command is a powerful and versatile non-interactive network downloader used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. Its name is derived from "World Wide Web" and "get," reflecting its primary purpose of retrieving content from the web. Unlike web browsers that require user interaction, wget can work in the background, making it ideal for downloading large files, mirroring websites, or automating download tasks.

Wget supports various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP, and can navigate through websites following links to create local copies of remote content. It's particularly valuable for its robustness over unstable network connections, as it can automatically retry downloads and resume interrupted transfers where supported.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the wget command is:

```bash
wget [options] [URL]
```

Where:
- **options**: Various flags that modify the behavior of wget
- **URL**: The web address of the file or resource to download

## Installation

Wget comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. To check if it's installed on your system, run:

```bash
wget --version
```

If it's not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager:

For Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget
```

For Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora:
```bash
sudo yum install wget
# or
sudo dnf install wget
```

## Basic Usage

### Downloading a Single File

To download a file from a URL:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file.zip
```

This command downloads the file and saves it in the current directory with the same filename as in the URL.

### Specifying Output Filename

To save the downloaded file with a different name:

```bash
wget -O custom_name.zip https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-O` (uppercase O) option specifies the output filename.

### Downloading in the Background

To run wget in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal:

```bash
wget -b https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

The `-b` option sends the process to the background. Output messages are redirected to a log file named `wget-log`.

## Advanced Usage

### Resuming Interrupted Downloads

If a download is interrupted, you can resume it from where it left off:

```bash
wget -c https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

The `-c` option tells wget to continue a partially downloaded file.

### Setting Retry Attempts

To specify the number of retry attempts for failed downloads:

```bash
wget --tries=10 https://example.com/file.zip
```

This sets wget to try up to 10 times before giving up. Use `0` or `inf` for infinite retrying.

### Limiting Download Speed

To restrict the download speed (useful to avoid consuming all available bandwidth):

```bash
wget --limit-rate=100k https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

This limits the download speed to 100 kilobytes per second.

### Setting Wait Time Between Retrievals

To add a delay between file retrievals (useful when downloading multiple files):

```bash
wget -w 2 https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip
```

The `-w` option sets a wait time of 2 seconds between downloads.

### Downloading Multiple Files

To download multiple files in a single command:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip
```

### Downloading from a List of URLs

To download files from a list stored in a text file:

```bash
wget -i url_list.txt
```

The `-i` option reads URLs from the specified file.

## Website Mirroring

### Basic Website Mirroring

To create a local copy of a website:

```bash
wget --mirror https://example.com/
```

The `--mirror` option is a shorthand for `-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing`.

### Recursive Download with Depth Limit

To download a website recursively with a specified depth:

```bash
wget -r -l 2 https://example.com/
```

The `-r` option enables recursive retrieval, and `-l 2` limits the recursion depth to 2 levels.

### Converting Links for Offline Viewing

To make the downloaded website viewable offline:

```bash
wget -r -k https://example.com/
```

The `-k` option converts links in downloaded HTML files to make them suitable for local viewing.

### Complete Website Mirroring

For a complete website mirror with all necessary options:

```bash
wget -m -p -k -E https://example.com/
```

This combines several options:
- `-m` (mirror): shorthand for `-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing`
- `-p` (page requisites): get all images and other elements needed to display the page
- `-k` (convert links): make links work locally
- `-E` (adjust extension): add .html extension to HTML files if needed

## Authentication

### Basic Authentication

To download content from a site requiring basic authentication:

```bash
wget --user=username --password=password https://example.com/protected/file.zip
```

### Using .netrc File for Authentication

For more secure authentication, you can use a .netrc file:

1. Create a .netrc file in your home directory:
   ```
   machine example.com
   login username
   password your_password
   ```

2. Set appropriate permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.netrc
   ```

3. Use wget with the netrc option:
   ```bash
   wget --netrc https://example.com/protected/file.zip
   ```

## Working with Proxies

### Using a Proxy Server

To download through a proxy server:

```bash
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=http://proxy_server:port https://example.com/file.zip
```

### Setting Proxy in Environment Variables

You can also set proxy settings as environment variables:

```bash
export http_proxy=http://proxy_server:port
export https_proxy=http://proxy_server:port
wget https://example.com/file.zip
```

## Logging and Output Control

### Redirecting Output to a Log File

To save wget's output messages to a specific log file:

```bash
wget -o download.log https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-o` (lowercase o) option specifies the log file.

### Appending to an Existing Log

To append output to an existing log file instead of overwriting it:

```bash
wget -a download.log https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-a` option appends to the specified log file.

### Quiet Mode

To suppress wget's output completely:

```bash
wget -q https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-q` option enables quiet mode.

### Verbose Mode

For detailed information about the download process:

```bash
wget -v https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-v` option enables verbose output.

### Debug Mode

For even more detailed information:

```bash
wget -d https://example.com/file.zip
```

The `-d` option enables debug output.

## Handling Cookies

### Saving Cookies

To save cookies from a website:

```bash
wget --save-cookies cookies.txt https://example.com/login
```

### Using Saved Cookies

To use previously saved cookies:

```bash
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt https://example.com/protected-area
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Downloading a File in the Background with Limited Speed

```bash
wget -b --limit-rate=200k -c https://example.com/large_file.iso
```

This downloads a file in the background, limits the download speed to 200 KB/s, and enables resume capability.

### Example 2: Mirroring a Website for Offline Viewing

```bash
wget -m -p -k -E -e robots=off https://example.com/docs/
```

This creates a complete mirror of the documentation section of a website, including all necessary resources for offline viewing, and ignores the robots.txt restrictions.

### Example 3: Downloading Files Matching a Pattern

```bash
wget -r -A "*.pdf" https://example.com/papers/
```

This recursively downloads all PDF files from the specified URL.

### Example 4: Downloading with Retry and Wait Time

```bash
wget --tries=5 -w 10 --random-wait https://example.com/file.zip
```

This sets wget to try up to 5 times, wait 10 seconds between retries, and add a random factor to the wait time.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "No such file or directory"

This error occurs when wget can't write to the specified output file:

```
Cannot write to 'output.file' (No such file or directory).
```

Solution: Check if the directory exists and if you have write permissions.

#### "Connection refused"

This error occurs when the server actively refuses the connection:

```
Connecting to example.com|93.184.216.34|:80... failed: Connection refused.
```

Solution: Verify that the URL is correct and the server is running.

#### "SSL certificate problem"

This error occurs when there's an issue with the SSL/TLS certificate:

```
ERROR: The certificate of 'example.com' is not trusted.
```

Solution: Use the `--no-check-certificate` option (only for testing purposes):

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate https://example.com/file.zip
```

### Debugging Tips

1. Use the `-d` option for detailed debug information:
   ```bash
   wget -d https://example.com/file.zip
   ```

2. Check the server's response headers:
   ```bash
   wget --server-response https://example.com/file.zip
   ```

3. Verify your proxy settings if you're behind a proxy:
   ```bash
   env | grep -i proxy
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**: Avoid using the `--password` option in command-line arguments as it may be visible in process listings. Use the `.netrc` file or environment variables instead.

2. **Certificate Validation**: Be cautious when using `--no-check-certificate` as it bypasses SSL/TLS certificate validation, potentially exposing you to man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **Website Scraping Ethics**: Respect the `robots.txt` file of websites unless you have permission to ignore it. Use the `-e robots=off` option responsibly.
