# Blocking vs Non-blocking Sockets

Socket operations can be performed in either blocking or non-blocking mode, each with its own advantages and challenges. Understanding these modes is crucial for designing efficient and responsive networked applications.

## Blocking Sockets

By default, socket operations in most systems are blocking. This means that when a program calls a socket function like `accept()`, `connect()`, `send()`, or `recv()`, the function does not return until the operation completes or an error occurs.

### Characteristics of Blocking Sockets

1. **Simplicity**: Blocking sockets are easier to program and reason about
2. **Sequential Execution**: Operations happen in a predictable sequence
3. **Resource Efficiency**: No need to constantly check for completion
4. **Thread Blocking**: The calling thread is blocked until the operation completes
5. **Potential Deadlocks**: Can lead to deadlocks if not carefully managed

### Example of Blocking Socket Operations

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define PORT 8080
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    int server_fd, client_fd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr, client_addr;
    socklen_t client_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Create socket
    server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (server_fd < 0) {
        perror("Socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Initialize server address
    memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    
    // Bind socket
    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("Bind failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Listen for connections
    if (listen(server_fd, 5) < 0) {
        perror("Listen failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    printf("Server listening on port %d...\n", PORT);
    
    // Accept connection (blocking call)
    client_fd = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_len);
    if (client_fd < 0) {
        perror("Accept failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    printf("Client connected: %s:%d\n", 
           inet_ntoa(client_addr.sin_addr), 
           ntohs(client_addr.sin_port));
    
    // Receive data (blocking call)
    ssize_t bytes_received = recv(client_fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, 0);
    if (bytes_received < 0) {
        perror("Receive failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
    printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);
    
    // Send response (blocking call)
    const char *response = "Message received";
    send(client_fd, response, strlen(response), 0);
    
    close(client_fd);
    close(server_fd);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `accept()`, `recv()`, and `send()` calls are all blocking. The program will wait at each of these calls until the operation completes or an error occurs.

## Non-blocking Sockets

Non-blocking sockets allow operations to return immediately, even if they cannot be completed right away. This enables a program to perform other tasks while waiting for socket operations to complete.

### Characteristics of Non-blocking Sockets

1. **Immediate Return**: Operations return immediately, regardless of completion
2. **Error Codes**: Special error codes indicate when operations would block
3. **Polling Required**: The application must check for completion
4. **Resource Intensive**: Constant checking can consume CPU resources
5. **Complexity**: More complex to program and reason about
6. **Responsiveness**: Can improve application responsiveness

### Setting a Socket to Non-blocking Mode

There are two common ways to set a socket to non-blocking mode:

#### Using fcntl()

```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int set_nonblocking(int sockfd) {
    int flags = fcntl(sockfd, F_GETFL, 0);
    if (flags == -1) {
        perror("fcntl F_GETFL");
        return -1;
    }
    
    if (fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK) == -1) {
        perror("fcntl F_SETFL O_NONBLOCK");
        return -1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Using ioctl()

```c
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int set_nonblocking(int sockfd) {
    int non_blocking = 1;
    if (ioctl(sockfd, FIONBIO, &non_blocking) == -1) {
        perror("ioctl FIONBIO");
        return -1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example of Non-blocking Socket Operations

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define PORT 8080
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

// Set socket to non-blocking mode
int set_nonblocking(int sockfd) {
    int flags = fcntl(sockfd, F_GETFL, 0);
    if (flags == -1) {
        perror("fcntl F_GETFL");
        return -1;
    }
    
    if (fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK) == -1) {
        perror("fcntl F_SETFL O_NONBLOCK");
        return -1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int server_fd, client_fd = -1;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr, client_addr;
    socklen_t client_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Create socket
    server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (server_fd < 0) {
        perror("Socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Set socket to non-blocking mode
    if (set_nonblocking(server_fd) < 0) {
        close(server_fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Initialize server address
    memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    
    // Bind socket
    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("Bind failed");
        close(server_fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Listen for connections
    if (listen(server_fd, 5) < 0) {
        perror("Listen failed");
        close(server_fd);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    printf("Server listening on port %d (non-blocking mode)...\n", PORT);
    
    // Main loop
    while (1) {
        // Try to accept a connection (non-blocking)
        if (client_fd < 0) {
            client_fd = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_len);
            
            if (client_fd < 0) {
                if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
                    // No connection available, do other work
                    printf("No connection available, doing other work...\n");
                    sleep(1);
                    continue;
                } else {
                    perror("Accept failed");
                    close(server_fd);
                    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                }
            }
            
            // Set client socket to non-blocking mode
            if (set_nonblocking(client_fd) < 0) {
                close(client_fd);
                client_fd = -1;
                continue;
            }
            
            printf("Client connected: %s:%d\n", 
                   inet_ntoa(client_addr.sin_addr), 
                   ntohs(client_addr.sin_port));
        }
        
        // Try to receive data (non-blocking)
        ssize_t bytes_received = recv(client_fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, 0);
        
        if (bytes_received < 0) {
            if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
                // No data available, do other work
                printf("No data available, doing other work...\n");
                sleep(1);
                continue;
            } else {
                perror("Receive failed");
                close(client_fd);
                client_fd = -1;
                continue;
            }
        } else if (bytes_received == 0) {
            // Connection closed by client
            printf("Client disconnected\n");
            close(client_fd);
            client_fd = -1;
            continue;
        }
        
        buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
        printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);
        
        // Try to send response (non-blocking)
        const char *response = "Message received";
        ssize_t bytes_sent = send(client_fd, response, strlen(response), 0);
        
        if (bytes_sent < 0) {
            if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
                // Cannot send now, try again later
                printf("Cannot send now, will try again...\n");
                sleep(1);
                continue;
            } else {
                perror("Send failed");
                close(client_fd);
                client_fd = -1;
                continue;
            }
        }
        
        printf("Response sent\n");
        
        // Close the connection after one message
        close(client_fd);
        client_fd = -1;
    }
    
    close(server_fd);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `accept()`, `recv()`, and `send()` calls are all non-blocking. When an operation would block, it returns immediately with an error code (`EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`), allowing the program to perform other tasks and try again later.

## Handling Non-blocking Operations

When using non-blocking sockets, you need to handle the special error codes that indicate an operation would block:

### EAGAIN / EWOULDBLOCK

These error codes (which are typically the same value) indicate that the operation cannot be completed immediately and would block if the socket were in blocking mode.

```c
ssize_t bytes_sent = send(sockfd, buffer, length, 0);
if (bytes_sent < 0) {
    if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
        // Operation would block, try again later
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Real error
        perror("send failed");
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### EINPROGRESS

This error code is returned by `connect()` when the connection cannot be established immediately.

```c
if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
    if (errno == EINPROGRESS) {
        // Connection in progress, check later for completion
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Real error
        perror("connect failed");
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Timeouts with Blocking Sockets

Even with blocking sockets, you can set timeouts to prevent operations from blocking indefinitely:

```c
// Set receive timeout to 5 seconds
struct timeval tv;
tv.tv_sec = 5;
tv.tv_usec = 0;
setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &tv, sizeof(tv));

// Now recv() will return with an error if no data is received within 5 seconds
ssize_t bytes_received = recv(sockfd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
if (bytes_received < 0) {
    if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
        // Timeout occurred
        printf("Receive timeout\n");
    } else {
        // Real error
        perror("recv failed");
    }
}
```

## Comparison: Blocking vs Non-blocking

| Aspect | Blocking | Non-blocking |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Ease of Use | Simpler to program | More complex |
| Resource Usage | Efficient when idle | May consume CPU with polling |
| Responsiveness | Thread blocks until completion | Immediate return, can do other work |
| Error Handling | Straightforward | Must handle special error codes |
| Concurrency Model | Typically multi-threaded | Can be single-threaded with event loop |
| Use Cases | Simple applications, per-client threads | High-performance servers, GUI applications |

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Blocking Sockets When:

1. **Simplicity is a priority**: The application logic is straightforward
2. **Using multiple threads**: Each connection has its own thread
3. **Operations are expected to complete quickly**: Minimal waiting time
4. **Resource efficiency is important**: No need for constant polling

### Use Non-blocking Sockets When:

1. **Handling many connections**: Need to manage many clients with few threads
2. **Responsiveness is critical**: Cannot afford to block the application
3. **Implementing event-driven architecture**: Using select(), poll(), or epoll()
4. **Building high-performance servers**: Need to maximize throughput
5. **Developing GUI applications**: Must keep the UI responsive

## Best Practices

### For Blocking Sockets:

1. **Set timeouts**: Prevent indefinite blocking
2. **Use multiple threads**: Handle multiple clients concurrently
3. **Implement proper error handling**: Recover from network issues
4. **Consider connection pooling**: Reuse connections when possible

### For Non-blocking Sockets:

1. **Use event notification**: Combine with select(), poll(), or epoll()
2. **Implement state machines**: Track the state of each connection
3. **Avoid busy waiting**: Don't continuously poll without sleeping
4. **Handle partial operations**: Send and receive may complete partially
5. **Use buffer management**: Efficiently handle data that cannot be sent immediately

## Conclusion

Both blocking and non-blocking sockets have their place in network programming. Blocking sockets are simpler to use but can limit responsiveness, while non-blocking sockets offer greater flexibility at the cost of increased complexity.

For simple applications or those with dedicated threads per connection, blocking sockets are often sufficient. For high-performance servers handling many connections, non-blocking sockets combined with event notification mechanisms like select(), poll(), or epoll() provide better scalability.

In the next section, we'll explore these event notification mechanisms in detail and learn how to implement efficient multiplexing with non-blocking sockets.
