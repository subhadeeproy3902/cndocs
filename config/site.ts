    "CN Docs serves as a comprehensive guide for students and enthusiasts diving into the world of computer networking. It covers essential theoretical concepts like the OSI and TCP/IP models, network devices, and IP addressing, while also providing practical insights through hands-on topics such as socket programming, inter-process communication (IPC), network troubleshooting, and data link layer mechanisms like flow and error control. Whether you're preparing for labs or building real-world networking applications, this guide bridges the gap between theory and implementation.",
