# NMCLI Command in Linux

## Introduction

The `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command-Line Interface) is a powerful command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and managing network connections in Linux systems. It provides a comprehensive interface for viewing, configuring, and troubleshooting network settings without requiring a graphical user interface.

NetworkManager is a daemon that manages network connections and devices, automatically connecting to available networks based on user preferences. The `nmcli` command serves as the primary command-line interface to interact with NetworkManager, making it essential for server administrators, network engineers, and users working in terminal environments.

## Basic Syntax

The general syntax for the `nmcli` command is:

```bash
nmcli [OPTIONS] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }
```

Where:
- **OPTIONS**: Additional parameters that modify the behavior of `nmcli`
- **OBJECT**: The target of the operation (e.g., connection, device, etc.)
- **COMMAND**: The action to be performed on the specified object
- **help**: Displays help information for the specified object

## Main Objects in NMCLI

The `nmcli` command works with several objects, each representing a different aspect of network configuration:

| Object | Description | Shorthand |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `general` | NetworkManager's general status and operations | `g` |
| `networking` | Overall networking control | `n` |
| `radio` | NetworkManager radio switches | `r` |
| `connection` | NetworkManager's connections | `c` |
| `device` | Network devices managed by NetworkManager | `d` |
| `agent` | NetworkManager secret agent or polkit agent | - |
| `monitor` | Monitor NetworkManager changes | - |

## Practical Examples

### 1. Viewing Network Connections

To list all available network connections on your system:

```bash
nmcli connection show
```

This command displays details such as connection name, UUID, type, and device.

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/nmcli-command.png" alt="NMCLI Connection Show Output" />

For a specific connection:

```bash
nmcli connection show "connection_name"
```

### 2. Checking Device Status

To view the status of all network devices:

```bash
nmcli device status
```

This command shows whether each device is connected or disconnected, along with the device type and connection it's associated with.

For detailed information about a specific device:

```bash
nmcli device show eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with your actual device name.

### 3. Managing Network Connections

#### Creating a New Connection

To create a new Ethernet connection:

```bash
nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname eth0 con-name "My Ethernet Connection"
```

To create a new Wi-Fi connection:

```bash
nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name "My WiFi" ssid "NetworkName"
```

#### Connecting to a Network

To connect to a saved network:

```bash
nmcli connection up "connection_name"
```

To connect to a new Wi-Fi network:

```bash
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "password"
```

#### Disconnecting from a Network

```bash
nmcli connection down "connection_name"
```

### 4. Modifying Connection Settings

To modify connection settings:

```bash
nmcli connection modify "connection_name" setting.property value
```

For example, to set a static IP address:

```bash
nmcli connection modify "My Ethernet Connection" ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.100/24" ipv4.gateway "192.168.1.1" ipv4.method manual
```

To set DNS servers:

```bash
nmcli connection modify "My Ethernet Connection" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
```

### 5. Managing Wi-Fi Networks

To scan for available Wi-Fi networks:

```bash
nmcli device wifi list
```

To connect to a Wi-Fi network:

```bash
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "password"
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Creating a Bridge Connection

```bash
nmcli connection add type bridge con-name "Bridge Connection" ifname br0
nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bridge con-name "Bridge Port 1" ifname eth0 master br0
```

### 2. Setting Up a VPN Connection

```bash
nmcli connection add type vpn con-name "My VPN" vpn-type openvpn -- ifname tun0 vpn.data "file=/path/to/config.ovpn"
```

### 3. Creating a Bond Connection

```bash
nmcli connection add type bond con-name "Bond Connection" ifname bond0 bond.options "mode=active-backup,miimon=100"
nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bond con-name "Bond Port 1" ifname eth0 master bond0
nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bond con-name "Bond Port 2" ifname eth1 master bond0
```

## Command Options

The `nmcli` command supports several options to modify its behavior:

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-t, --terse` | Terse output suitable for script processing | `nmcli -t device status` |
| `-p, --pretty` | Pretty output for better human readability | `nmcli -p device status` |
| `-m, --mode` | Output mode: tabular or multiline | `nmcli -m tabular device status` |
| `-f, --fields` | Specify fields to display | `nmcli -f DEVICE,STATE device status` |
| `-e, --escape` | Escape column separators in values | `nmcli -e yes device status` |
| `-v, --version` | Show version information | `nmcli -v` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help information | `nmcli -h` |

### Examples of Options

#### Terse Output

```bash
nmcli -t device status
```

This produces output with fields separated by colons, suitable for parsing in scripts.

#### Pretty Output

```bash
nmcli -p device status
```

This formats the output in a more human-readable way with proper alignment and borders.

#### Specific Fields

```bash
nmcli -f DEVICE,STATE,CONNECTION device status
```

This displays only the specified fields (device name, state, and connection).

## Troubleshooting Network Issues

### 1. Checking NetworkManager Status

```bash
nmcli general status
```

### 2. Restarting NetworkManager

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### 3. Reloading a Connection

```bash
nmcli connection reload
```

### 4. Monitoring Network Changes

```bash
nmcli monitor
```

This command continuously monitors and displays NetworkManager activity.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Connection Names**: Always use descriptive connection names for easier management.

2. **Check Before Modifying**: Always check the current settings before making modifications:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection show "connection_name"
   ```

3. **Save Changes**: After modifying a connection, remember to bring it down and up again to apply changes:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection down "connection_name"
   nmcli connection up "connection_name"
   ```

4. **Use Tab Completion**: The `nmcli` command supports tab completion, which can help you discover available options and commands.

5. **Script Automation**: Use the terse output mode (`-t`) when incorporating `nmcli` commands in scripts for easier parsing.

## Conclusion

The `nmcli` command is an essential tool for managing network connections in Linux environments. Its comprehensive feature set allows for complete control over NetworkManager from the command line, making it invaluable for server administration, automation, and troubleshooting network issues.

Whether you're configuring a simple home network or managing complex enterprise networking environments, mastering `nmcli` provides you with the flexibility and power needed to efficiently manage network connections in Linux systems.
