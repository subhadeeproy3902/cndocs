## 💻 Code Examples

Each topic includes practical, well-commented code examples that demonstrate key concepts. Our examples:

- Follow best practices for production-ready code
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear comments explaining each step
- Are tested in real-world scenarios
- Include both basic and advanced implementations

Example from our Client-Server Architecture section:

```c
// Message header structure
struct message_header {
    uint8_t  version;       // Protocol version
    uint8_t  type;          // Message type
    uint16_t command;       // Command identifier
    uint32_t payload_size;  // Size of the payload
    uint32_t sequence_id;   // Message sequence number
};

// Complete message structure
struct message {
    struct message_header header;
    char payload[MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE];
};
```

```bash
bun run add-doc <url>
```

This automatically:

- Scrapes content from the provided URL
- Downloads images to the public folder
- Generates well-formatted MDX files
- Applies proper formatting and styling

### Manual Content Creation

1. Create a new MDX file in the appropriate directory under `content/docs/`
2. Add frontmatter with title and description
3. Write your content using Markdown and MDX components
4. Add code examples, images, and other resources as needed
