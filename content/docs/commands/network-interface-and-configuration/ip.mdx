# IP Command in Linux: The Modern Replacement for ifconfig

## Introduction

The `ip` command is a powerful and versatile networking utility in Linux systems that serves as the modern replacement for traditional networking tools like `ifconfig`, `route`, and `arp`. Part of the `iproute2` package, the `ip` command provides a unified interface for configuring and managing various aspects of network settings in modern Linux distributions.

Unlike its predecessors, the `ip` command offers more features, better performance, and a more consistent syntax for managing network interfaces, routing tables, addresses, and more. This comprehensive documentation explores the capabilities, syntax, and practical applications of the `ip` command.

## Basic Syntax

The general syntax of the `ip` command follows this pattern:

```bash
ip [OPTIONS] OBJECT {COMMAND | help}
```

Where:
- **OPTIONS**: Additional parameters that modify the behavior of the command
- **OBJECT**: The networking component you want to interact with (e.g., link, address, route)
- **COMMAND**: The action you want to perform on the specified object
- **help**: Displays help information about the specified object or command

## Common Objects in the IP Command

The `ip` command works with several objects, each representing a different aspect of network configuration:

| Object | Description | Equivalent Legacy Command |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `link` | Network interfaces | `ifconfig` |
| `address` (or `addr`) | Protocol addresses on network interfaces | `ifconfig`, `inet` |
| `route` | Routing table entries | `route` |
| `neigh` | ARP or NDISC cache entries | `arp` |
| `tunnel` | Tunnel over IP | `iptunnel` |
| `maddr` | Multicast addresses | `ipmaddr` |
| `mroute` | Multicast routing cache entries | `iproute` |
| `rule` | Rules in routing policy database | `ip rule` |

## Key IP Command Operations

### 1. Managing Network Interfaces with `ip link`

The `ip link` object allows you to view and manage network interfaces at the link layer.

#### Displaying Network Interfaces

To list all network interfaces:

```bash
ip link show
# or shorter form
ip l
```

This command displays information about all network interfaces, including their state (UP/DOWN), MAC address, and other link-layer details.

#### Activating or Deactivating an Interface

To bring an interface up (activate it):

```bash
sudo ip link set dev eth0 up
```

To bring an interface down (deactivate it):

```bash
sudo ip link set dev eth0 down
```

#### Changing Interface Properties

To change the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of an interface:

```bash
sudo ip link set dev eth0 mtu 1500
```

To change the MAC address of an interface:

```bash
sudo ip link set dev eth0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

### 2. Managing IP Addresses with `ip address`

The `ip address` (or `ip addr`) object allows you to view and manage IP addresses assigned to network interfaces.

#### Displaying IP Addresses

To show IP addresses for all interfaces:

```bash
ip address show
# or shorter form
ip a
```

To show IP addresses for a specific interface:

```bash
ip address show dev eth0
```

#### Adding an IP Address to an Interface

To add an IPv4 address to an interface:

```bash
sudo ip address add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

To add an IPv6 address to an interface:

```bash
sudo ip address add 2001:db8::1/64 dev eth0
```

#### Removing an IP Address from an Interface

To remove an IPv4 address from an interface:

```bash
sudo ip address del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

### 3. Managing Routing with `ip route`

The `ip route` object allows you to view and manage the routing table.

#### Displaying Routes

To show the routing table:

```bash
ip route show
# or shorter form
ip r
```

#### Adding a Route

To add a default route (gateway):

```bash
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

To add a route to a specific network:

```bash
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 192.168.1.254 dev eth0
```

#### Deleting a Route

To delete a route:

```bash
sudo ip route del 10.0.0.0/24
```

#### Finding the Route for a Specific Destination

To find which route would be used to reach a specific IP address:

```bash
ip route get 8.8.8.8
```

### 4. Managing ARP Cache with `ip neigh`

The `ip neigh` object allows you to view and manage the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache.

#### Displaying ARP Cache

To show the ARP cache:

```bash
ip neigh show
```

#### Adding an ARP Entry

To add a static ARP entry:

```bash
sudo ip neigh add 192.168.1.5 lladdr 00:11:22:33:44:55 dev eth0
```

#### Deleting an ARP Entry

To delete an ARP entry:

```bash
sudo ip neigh del 192.168.1.5 dev eth0
```

## Advanced IP Command Features

### 1. Network Namespaces

Network namespaces allow for isolated network environments within a single Linux system. The `ip netns` command is used to manage these namespaces.

```bash
# Create a new namespace
sudo ip netns add mynetns

# List all namespaces
ip netns list

# Execute a command in a namespace
sudo ip netns exec mynetns ip addr
```

### 2. Virtual Ethernet Interfaces

Virtual Ethernet (veth) interfaces are used to create tunnels between network namespaces.

```bash
# Create a veth pair
sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1

# Move one end to a namespace
sudo ip link set veth1 netns mynetns
```

### 3. Traffic Control

The `ip` command can be used with the `tc` (Traffic Control) subsystem to manage network traffic.

```bash
# Add a queueing discipline
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms

# Show queueing disciplines
tc qdisc show dev eth0
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Setting Up a Secondary IP Address

```bash
# Add a secondary IP address to eth0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.10/24 dev eth0

# Verify the configuration
ip addr show dev eth0
```

### Example 2: Creating a Static Route for a Specific Network

```bash
# Add a route to the 10.0.0.0/8 network via a specific gateway
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.1.254 dev eth0

# Verify the route
ip route show
```

### Example 3: Monitoring Interface Statistics

```bash
# Show detailed statistics for an interface
ip -s link show dev eth0
```

## Comparison with Legacy Commands

| Task | Legacy Command | IP Command |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Show interfaces | `ifconfig` | `ip link show` |
| Show IP addresses | `ifconfig` | `ip addr show` |
| Add IP address | `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0` | `ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0` |
| Show routing table | `route -n` | `ip route show` |
| Add default gateway | `route add default gw 192.168.1.1` | `ip route add default via 192.168.1.1` |
| Show ARP cache | `arp -n` | `ip neigh show` |

## Conclusion

The `ip` command is a powerful and versatile tool for network configuration and management in Linux systems. It provides a unified interface for managing various aspects of networking, from interfaces and addresses to routes and ARP cache entries. By mastering the `ip` command, system administrators and network engineers can efficiently configure and troubleshoot network-related issues in modern Linux environments.

As Linux networking continues to evolve, the `ip` command remains an essential tool in the administrator's toolkit, offering more features and better performance than its legacy counterparts. Whether you're configuring a simple home network or managing complex enterprise networking environments, the `ip` command provides the flexibility and power needed to get the job done efficiently.
