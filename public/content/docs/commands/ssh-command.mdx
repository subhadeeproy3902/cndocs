# SSH Command

## Introduction

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure remote access to systems over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using strong encryption, allowing you to securely connect to remote machines, execute commands, transfer files, and much more.

SSH is the de facto standard for remote administration of Unix-like systems, but it's also incredibly versatile and can be used for many creative purposes beyond simple remote access.

## Basic SSH Usage

### Connecting to a Remote System

The most basic use of SSH is to connect to a remote system:

```bash
ssh username@hostname_or_ip
```

For example:
```bash
ssh john@192.168.1.100
```

> If admin restrictions are enabled then do the following:
> ```bash
> ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no username@hostname_or_ip
> ```

### Using a Different Port

By default, SSH uses port 22. To connect to a server using a different port:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@hostname_or_ip
```

### Using SSH Keys for Authentication

SSH keys provide a more secure way to log in compared to using passwords:

1. Generate a key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Copy your public key to the server:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id username@hostname_or_ip
   ```

3. Now you can connect without a password:
   ```bash
   ssh username@hostname_or_ip
   ```

## Power User Features

### Access Your Entire System from Your Terminal

SSH gives you complete access to a remote system's terminal, allowing you to:

1. **Navigate the file system**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'ls -la /home/user/documents'
   ```

2. **View and edit files**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf'
   ssh user@server 'nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf'  # Interactive session
   ```

3. **Monitor system resources**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'htop'  # Interactive session
   ssh user@server 'free -h && df -h'
   ```

4. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'tail -f /var/log/syslog'
   ```

### Start or Kill Applications Remotely

SSH allows you to manage applications on remote systems:

1. **Start an application**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'nohup firefox &'  # Start Firefox
   ```

2. **Kill a specific application**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'pkill firefox'  # Kill Firefox
   ```

3. **Start a service**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'sudo systemctl start nginx'
   ```

4. **Stop a service**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'sudo systemctl stop nginx'
   ```

5. **Restart a service**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'
   ```

### Clean Your System from Your Phone

You can perform system maintenance from anywhere, even from your phone using an SSH client app:

```bash
ssh user@server 'sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt clean'
```

This command removes unnecessary packages and clears the local repository of retrieved package files, freeing up disk space.

### Automate System Updates Remotely

Keep your system up-to-date without physically accessing it:

```bash
ssh user@server 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
```

For a more comprehensive update including distribution upgrades:

```bash
ssh user@server 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y'
```

## üé® Pranks & Fun (Harmless and with Permission!)

**Important Note**: Always get explicit permission before running these commands on someone else's system. These pranks are meant to be harmless and fun, not malicious or disruptive.

### üí¨ Send Remote Desktop Notifications

Surprise your colleagues with unexpected notifications:

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 notify-send "üëª Boo!" "Your computer is haunted!"'
```

For a more persistent notification:

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -u critical "üö® System Alert" "Coffee break detected. Please return to your desk!"'
```

### üéµ Play Audio Remotely

Play sounds or music on the remote computer:

```bash
# Play a sound file
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga'
```

For text-to-speech fun:

```bash
# Make the computer speak
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 espeak "I am watching you"'
```

### üñºÔ∏è Change Their Desktop Wallpaper

Surprise them with a new desktop background:

```bash
# For GNOME desktop
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/user/Pictures/funny_wallpaper.jpg'
```

```bash
# For KDE Plasma
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 qdbus org.kde.plasmashell /PlasmaShell org.kde.PlasmaShell.evaluateScript "var allDesktops = desktops();for (i=0;i<allDesktops.length;i++){d = allDesktops[i];d.wallpaperPlugin=\"org.kde.image\";d.currentConfigGroup = Array(\"Wallpaper\", \"org.kde.image\", \"General\");d.writeConfig(\"Image\", \"file:///home/user/Pictures/funny_wallpaper.jpg\")}"'
```

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Open Random Terminals with Messages

Make terminals pop up with custom messages:

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 gnome-terminal -- bash -c "echo \"The matrix has you...\"; sleep 5"'
```

For a more dramatic effect:

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 gnome-terminal -- bash -c "echo -e \"\033[31mWARNING: System will self-destruct in:\033[0m\"; for i in {10..1}; do echo -e \"\033[31m$i\033[0m\"; sleep 1; done; echo -e \"\033[32mJust kidding! Have a nice day!\033[0m\"; sleep 5"'
```

### üì∑ Take a Screenshot of Their Screen

Capture what they're doing (with permission, of course):

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 import -window root screenshot.png'
```

Or with GNOME Screenshot:

```bash
ssh user@server 'DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screenshot -f /home/user/screenshot.png'
```

## Advanced SSH Techniques

### SSH Tunneling (Port Forwarding)

SSH tunneling allows you to securely access services that are not directly accessible:

1. **Local Port Forwarding** (access remote service through local port):
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@server
   ```
   This forwards your local port 8080 to port 80 on the remote server.

2. **Remote Port Forwarding** (expose local service to remote system):
   ```bash
   ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 user@server
   ```
   This exposes your local port 80 to port 8080 on the remote server.

3. **Dynamic Port Forwarding** (SOCKS proxy):
   ```bash
   ssh -D 1080 user@server
   ```
   This creates a SOCKS proxy on your local port 1080.

### X11 Forwarding

Run graphical applications on a remote system but display them locally:

```bash
ssh -X user@server
```

Once connected, you can launch graphical applications:

```bash
firefox &
```

### SSH Config File

Create an `~/.ssh/config` file to simplify connections:

```
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User john
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can simply use:

```bash
ssh myserver
```

### SSH Agent

SSH Agent manages your keys and remembers your passphrase:

```bash
# Start the agent
eval $(ssh-agent)

# Add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Executing Multiple Commands

You can execute multiple commands in a single SSH session:

```bash
ssh user@server 'command1 && command2 && command3'
```

### Running Commands in the Background

To run commands that continue after you disconnect:

```bash
ssh user@server 'nohup long-running-command > output.log 2>&1 &'
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use SSH keys instead of passwords**
2. **Disable root login**:
   ```
   # In /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```
3. **Change the default port**:
   ```
   # In /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   Port 2222
   ```
4. **Implement fail2ban** to protect against brute force attacks
5. **Keep your SSH client and server updated**
6. **Use strong passphrases for your SSH keys**
7. **Limit user access** with AllowUsers or AllowGroups in sshd_config

## Fun SSH Projects

### Create a Remote Control for Your Computer

Write a simple script that accepts commands via SSH:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as remote_control.sh

case "$1" in
  "lock")
    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command -l
    echo "Computer locked"
    ;;
  "unlock")
    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screensaver-command -d
    echo "Computer unlocked"
    ;;
  "screenshot")
    DISPLAY=:0 gnome-screenshot -f /home/user/remote_screenshot.png
    echo "Screenshot taken"
    ;;
  "message")
    DISPLAY=:0 notify-send "Remote Message" "$2"
    echo "Message sent"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown command"
    ;;
esac
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x remote_control.sh
```

Use it remotely:
```bash
ssh user@server './remote_control.sh lock'
ssh user@server './remote_control.sh message "Time for a meeting!"'
```

### Set Up a Remote Monitoring Dashboard

Create a simple monitoring script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as system_status.sh

echo "=== System Status ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""
echo "=== CPU Usage ==="
top -bn1 | head -n 5
echo ""
echo "=== Memory Usage ==="
free -h
echo ""
echo "=== Disk Usage ==="
df -h
echo ""
echo "=== Network Connections ==="
netstat -tuln
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x system_status.sh
```

Run it remotely:
```bash
ssh user@server './system_status.sh'
```
