# Networking Commands

Networking commands are essential tools for system administrators, network engineers, and developers to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot network connections. These commands provide insights into network interfaces, connections, routing, and more.

## Core Networking Commands

This section covers fundamental networking commands used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems:

- [**ifconfig**](/docs/commands/ifconfig) - Configure and display network interface information
- [**ip**](/docs/commands/ip-command) - Modern replacement for ifconfig with extended capabilities
- [**nmcli**](/docs/commands/nmcli) - NetworkManager command-line interface for managing network connections
- [**nmtui**](/docs/commands/nmtui) - NetworkManager text user interface for easy network configuration
- **ping** - Test network connectivity to a host
- **netstat** - Display network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics
- **traceroute** - Trace the route packets take to a network host
- **nslookup/dig** - Query DNS servers for domain information
- **route** - View and manipulate the IP routing table
- **ss** - Display socket statistics
- **tcpdump** - Capture and analyze network packets

Each command serves a specific purpose in network management and troubleshooting, helping you understand and control how your system interacts with local and remote networks.

## Why Learn Networking Commands?

Understanding networking commands provides several benefits:

1. **Troubleshooting Skills** - Diagnose and resolve network connectivity issues
2. **System Administration** - Configure and manage network interfaces effectively
3. **Security Analysis** - Identify suspicious network activity and connections
4. **Performance Optimization** - Monitor network traffic and identify bottlenecks
5. **Automation** - Incorporate these commands into scripts for network management

Whether you're setting up a new server, diagnosing connection problems, or securing your network, these commands form the foundation of effective network management.
