# Common Challenges of Computer Network

## 1. Performance Degradation
Many times we face loss in data integrity and network speed, commonly due to poor transmissions â€” this is known as performance degradation. It affects all networks, whether large or small. However, large networks are more prone to this issue because communication needs to be established over a wider area using many networking devices.

## 2. Security Issues
Security is one of the top concerns in computer networks. It poses a major challenge to network security engineers and includes:
- Protecting networks from cyber attacks
- Preventing unauthorized access
- Maintaining network integrity

As network size increases, the chances of security breaches also grow.

## 3. Host Identification
Manual addressing works for small networks, but becomes difficult in large-scale networks. Without proper host identification, establishing communication becomes challenging. Accurate addressing is critical for effective network communication.

## 4. Configuration Conflicts
Large networks often suffer from configuration conflicts due to increased traffic and device complexity. Small networks, with fewer IP addresses and unique hostnames, experience fewer conflicts. However, modern network designs are now better equipped to handle such conflicts efficiently.

## 5. Capacity Concern
With massive data generation from IoT, Big Data, and Data Science, network capacity must scale accordingly. Future technologies will add even more demand, requiring constant capacity upgrades while also managing evolving cyber threats.

## 6. Slow Connectivity
Slow network connectivity can be frustrating, especially during large file transfers. This commonly affects users working over extended networks, becoming a significant challenge in maintaining efficiency and productivity.

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance
Monitoring and maintaining a global or large-scale network is a critical and complex task. With the ever-growing volume of data traffic, ensuring smooth network operation and identifying issues becomes increasingly difficult.
