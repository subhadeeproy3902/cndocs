# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to automate the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. Instead of manually configuring each device with an IP address, DHCP allows devices to connect to a network and receive all necessary network information automatically from a DHCP server.

This makes it easier to manage and maintain large networks, ensuring devices can communicate effectively without conflicts in their network settings. DHCP plays a crucial role in modern networks by simplifying the process of connecting devices and managing network resources efficiently.

## What is DHCP?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a critical feature that enables users of an enterprise network to communicate. DHCP helps enterprises to smoothly manage the allocation of IP addresses to end-user clients' devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and other network-connected devices.

DHCP is an application layer protocol that provides:

- Subnet Mask (Option 1 - e.g., 255.255.255.0)
- Router Address (Option 3 - e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- DNS Address (Option 6 - e.g., 8.8.8.8)
- Vendor Class Identifier (Option 43 - e.g., 'unifi' = 192.168.1.9 where unifi = controller)

DHCP is based on a client-server model and operates through a process of discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment (often called the DORA process).

## Why Do We Use DHCP?

DHCP helps in managing the entire IP address allocation process automatically and centrally. It maintains a unique IP address for each host using the server. DHCP servers maintain information on TCP/IP configuration and provide configuration of addresses to DHCP-enabled clients in the form of a lease offer.

## Components of DHCP

The main components of DHCP include:

- **DHCP Server**: A server that holds IP addresses and other network configuration information.
- **DHCP Client**: A device that receives configuration information from the server. It can be a mobile device, laptop, computer, or any other electronic device that requires a network connection.
- **DHCP Relay**: Acts as a communication channel between DHCP clients and servers, especially when they are on different networks.
- **IP Address Pool**: The collection of IP addresses possessed by the DHCP server that can be allocated to devices.
- **Subnets**: Smaller portions of the IP network partitioned to keep networks under control.
- **Lease**: The time period for which the information received from the server is valid. When the lease expires, the client must renew it.
- **DNS Servers**: DHCP servers can also provide DNS server information to clients, allowing them to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- **Default Gateway**: Information about the router that packets are sent to when the destination is outside the local network.
- **Options**: Additional configuration options such as subnet mask, domain name, and time server information.
- **Renewal**: The process by which DHCP clients request to renew their lease before it expires.
- **Failover**: A configuration where two DHCP servers work together to provide redundancy.
- **Dynamic Updates**: DHCP servers can dynamically update DNS records with the IP address of DHCP clients.
- **Audit Logging**: DHCP servers can keep logs of all DHCP transactions for administrative visibility.

## DHCP Packet Format

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/dhcp-packet-format.png" alt="DHCP Packet Format" />

- **Hardware Length**: An 8-bit field defining the length of the physical address in bytes. For Ethernet, the value is 6.
- **Hop Count**: An 8-bit field defining the maximum number of hops the packet can travel.
- **Transaction ID**: A 4-byte field carrying an integer. The transaction identification is set by the client and is used to match a reply with the request.
- **Number of Seconds**: A 16-bit field that indicates the number of seconds elapsed since the client started to boot.
- **Flag**: A 16-bit field in which only the leftmost bit is used. A leftmost bit of 1 specifies a forced broadcast reply from the server.
- **Client IP Address**: A 4-byte field that contains the client IP address. If the client does not have this information, this field has a value of 0.
- **Your IP Address**: A 4-byte field that contains the client IP address. It is filled by the server at the request of the client.
- **Server IP Address**: A 4-byte field containing the server IP address. It is filled by the server in a reply message.
- **Gateway IP Address**: A 4-byte field containing the IP address of a router. It is filled by the server in a reply message.
- **Client Hardware Address**: The physical address of the client.
- **Server Name**: A 64-byte field that is optionally filled by the server in a reply packet.
- **Boot Filename**: A 128-byte field that can be optionally filled by the server in a reply packet.
- **Options**: A 64-byte field with a dual purpose. It can carry either additional information or some specific vendor information.

## Working of DHCP

DHCP works on the Application layer of the UDP Protocol. The main task of DHCP is to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients and allocate information on TCP/IP configuration to clients.

The DHCP port number for the server is 67 and for the client is 68. It is a client-server protocol that uses UDP services. An IP address is assigned from a pool of addresses. In DHCP, the client and the server exchange mainly 4 DHCP messages in order to make a connection, also called the DORA process, but there are 8 DHCP messages in total that can be used in the process.

## The 8 DHCP Messages

### 1. DHCP Discover Message

This is the first message generated in the communication process between the server and the client. This message is generated by the client host to discover if there are any DHCP servers present in a network. This message is broadcasted to all devices present in a network to find the DHCP server. This message is 342 or 576 bytes long.

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/dhcp-discover.png" alt="DHCP Discover Message" />

As shown in the figure, the source MAC address (client PC) is 08002B2EAF2A, the destination MAC address (server) is FFFFFFFFFFFF, the source IP address is 0.0.0.0 (because the PC has no IP address yet) and the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 (broadcast IP address).

### 2. DHCP Offer Message

The server will respond to the host with this message, specifying an unleased IP address and other TCP configuration information. This message is broadcasted by the server. The size of the message is 342 bytes. If there is more than one DHCP server present in the network, the client host will accept the first DHCP OFFER message it receives.

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/dhcp-offer.png" alt="DHCP Offer Message" />

For the offer message, the source IP address is the server's IP address, the destination IP address is the broadcast IP address, the source MAC address is the server's MAC address, and the destination MAC address is the client's MAC address. The server provides the offered IP address and a lease time (after this time the entry of the host will be erased from the server automatically).

### 3. DHCP Request Message

When a client receives an offer message, it responds by broadcasting a DHCP request message. The client will produce a gratuitous ARP to find if there is any other host present in the network with the same IP address. If there is no reply from another host, then the message is broadcasted to the server showing the acceptance of the IP address.

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/dhcp-request.png" alt="DHCP Request Message" />

The request message is broadcast by the client PC, so the source IP address is 0.0.0.0 (as the client has no IP yet) and the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 (the broadcast IP address).

### 4. DHCP Acknowledgment Message

In response to the request message received, the server will make an entry with a specified client ID and bind the IP address offered with lease time. Now, the client will have the IP address provided by the server.

<img className="max-w-xl mx-auto" src="/images/dhcp-acknowledgement.png" alt="DHCP Acknowledgment Message" />

The server will make an entry of the client host with the offered IP address and lease time. This IP address will not be provided by the server to any other host.

### 5. DHCP Negative Acknowledgment Message

Whenever a DHCP server receives a request for an IP address that is invalid according to the scopes that are configured, it sends a DHCP NAK message to the client. For example, when the server has no unused IP addresses or the pool is empty, this message is sent by the server to the client.

### 6. DHCP Decline

If the DHCP client determines the offered configuration parameters are different or invalid, it sends a DHCP decline message to the server. When there is a reply to the gratuitous ARP by any host to the client, the client sends a DHCP decline message to the server showing the offered IP address is already in use.

### 7. DHCP Release

A DHCP client sends a DHCP release packet to the server to release the IP address and cancel any remaining lease time.

### 8. DHCP Inform

If a client has obtained an IP address manually, it uses DHCP inform to obtain other local configuration parameters, such as domain name. In reply to the DHCP inform message, the DHCP server generates a DHCP ACK message with a local configuration suitable for the client without allocating a new IP address.

## Security Considerations for Using DHCP

To ensure DHCP servers are secure, consider these security issues:

- **Limited IP Addresses**: A DHCP server can only offer a set number of IP addresses. Attackers could flood the server with requests, causing essential devices to lose their connection.
- **Fake DHCP Servers**: Attackers might set up fake DHCP servers to give out fake IP addresses to devices on your network.
- **DNS Access**: When users get an IP address from DHCP, they also get DNS server details. This could potentially allow them to access more data than they should. It's important to restrict network access, use firewalls, and secure connections with VPNs to protect against this.

## Protection Against DHCP Starvation Attack

A DHCP starvation attack happens when a hacker floods a DHCP server with requests for IP addresses. This overwhelms the server, making it unable to assign addresses to legitimate users. The hacker can then block access for authorized users and potentially set up a fake DHCP server to intercept and manipulate network traffic, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.

## Reasons Why Enterprises Must Automate DHCP

Automating your DHCP system is crucial for businesses because it reduces the time and effort your IT team spends on manual tasks. For instance, DHCP-related issues like printers not connecting or subnets not working with the main network can be avoided automatically.

Automated DHCP also allows your operations to grow smoothly. Instead of hiring more staff to handle tasks that automation can manage, your team can focus on other important areas of business growth.

## Advantages of DHCP

- Centralized management of IP addresses
- Centralized and automated TCP/IP configuration
- Ease of adding new clients to a network
- Reuse of IP addresses reduces the total number of IP addresses required
- Efficient handling of IP address changes for clients that must be updated frequently
- Simple reconfiguration of the IP address space on the DHCP server without needing to reconfigure each client
- The DHCP protocol gives the network administrator a method to configure the network from a centralized area
- Easy handling of new users and the reuse of IP addresses

## Disadvantages of DHCP

- IP conflicts can occur
- Clients accept any server, which can be a security risk if another server is in the vicinity
- The client is not able to access the network in the absence of a DHCP server
- The name of the machine will not be changed when a new IP address is assigned

## Conclusion

In conclusion, DHCP is a technology that simplifies network setup by automatically assigning IP addresses and network configurations to devices. While DHCP offers convenience, it's important to manage its security carefully. Issues such as IP address exhaustion and potential data access through DNS settings highlight the need for robust security measures like firewalls and VPNs to protect networks from unauthorized access and disruptions. DHCP remains essential for efficiently managing network connections while ensuring security against potential risks.
