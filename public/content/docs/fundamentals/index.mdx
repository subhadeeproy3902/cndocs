# Getting Started  
## Your Journey into Computer Networking Begins

Welcome! You're about to embark on a journey to understand the fundamental concepts behind **Computer Networking**. This knowledge is essential for anyone aiming to build systems, secure data, or understand how devices communicate across the globe. Think of it as laying the groundwork for any modern computing system — without it, nothing connects.

This guide is designed to be **clear, beginner-friendly, and hands-on**, especially if you're new to networking. We'll avoid overwhelming jargon and focus on real-world applications and even include **code examples** and **simulations** using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and **Wireshark**.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

We’ll be covering these **core topics**:

- **The Internet vs. Networks**  
  Understand the difference between the internet (a global network of networks) and smaller internal networks like LAN and WAN.

- **Clients and Servers**  
  Explore how devices communicate in a network — from requesting data to delivering responses — the core of all digital interactions.

- **IP Addresses and DNS**  
  Learn how each device gets a unique address and how **DNS** works like the "phonebook" of the internet.

- **OSI and TCP/IP Models**  
  Master the 7-layer model and the 4-layer alternative that power all data communication.

- **Routing & Switching**  
  Discover how routers and switches move packets efficiently across the network.

- **Networking Commands & Code**  
  Get your hands dirty with commands like `ifconfig`, `netstat`, `nslookup`, and code snippets using **Python sockets** and **C TCP/UDP programs**.

- **HTTP, FTP, DHCP, and more**  
  Understand key protocols used in real-world networking and web interaction.

- **Subnetting and IPv4/IPv6**  
  Dive into IP addressing schemes and learn how to calculate subnets like a pro.

- **Network Security Basics**  
  Learn about firewalls, encryption, common attacks (DoS, MITM), and how to defend against them.

## 📍 Roadmap

Here's why understanding networking is **crucial**:

- **Systems Programming**: Knowing how networks work makes you a better programmer and troubleshooter.
- **DevOps and Cloud**: Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms all rely on strong networking foundations.
- **Cybersecurity**: From ethical hacking to protecting APIs, everything begins with understanding network communication.
- **Real-world Code**: You'll be writing and running **client-server code**, simulating data packets, and using networking tools in real time.
- **Interview Prep**: Networking questions often come up in job interviews — understanding these concepts can give you a huge edge.
