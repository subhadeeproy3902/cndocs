# nft Command

## Introduction

The `nft` command is the user-space utility for the nftables framework, which is the modern replacement for iptables, ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables in Linux. Introduced in Linux kernel 3.13, nftables provides a more consistent and flexible syntax, improved performance, and a unified approach to packet filtering and classification.

Unlike its predecessor iptables, which used separate tools for different protocol families, nftables uses a single tool (`nft`) and a unified syntax for all protocol families. This simplification, along with other architectural improvements, makes nftables more powerful and easier to use for network administrators and security professionals.

## Basic Concepts

Before diving into nft commands, it's important to understand some key concepts:

### Tables

Tables are the top-level containers in nftables. They group related chains together and are associated with a specific address family:

- **ip**: IPv4 packets
- **ip6**: IPv6 packets
- **inet**: Both IPv4 and IPv6 packets
- **arp**: ARP packets
- **bridge**: Ethernet frames passing through bridges
- **netdev**: Packets from ingress (and egress in newer kernels)

### Chains

Chains are containers for rules. There are two types of chains:

- **Base chains**: Entry points for packets from the networking stack, with a specific hook and priority
- **Regular chains**: Used for better organization and can be called from base chains

### Rules

Rules contain matches (conditions) and actions (statements) that determine what happens to packets.

### Sets and Maps

Sets are collections of elements used for efficient lookups. Maps associate keys with values for quick transformations.

## Installation

nftables is typically included in modern Linux distributions. If it's not installed, you can add it using your distribution's package manager:

### Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nftables
```

### Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora Systems

```bash
# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install nftables

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install nftables
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S nftables
```

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the nft command is:

```bash
nft [options] [command] [expression]
```

Where:
- **options**: Various flags that modify the behavior of nft
- **command**: The action to perform (add, delete, list, etc.)
- **expression**: The object to operate on (table, chain, rule, etc.)

## Basic Usage

### Listing Tables

To list all tables:

```bash
nft list tables
```

To list tables of a specific family:

```bash
nft list tables ip
```

### Listing Chains

To list all chains in a specific table:

```bash
nft list chains ip filter
```

### Listing Rules

To list all rules in a specific table:

```bash
nft list table ip filter
```

To list all rules in a specific chain:

```bash
nft list chain ip filter input
```

### Listing the Entire Ruleset

To list the entire ruleset:

```bash
nft list ruleset
```

## Managing Tables

### Creating a Table

To create a new table:

```bash
nft add table ip filter
```

This creates a table named "filter" in the "ip" family.

### Deleting a Table

To delete a table:

```bash
nft delete table ip filter
```

### Flushing a Table

To remove all chains and rules from a table:

```bash
nft flush table ip filter
```

## Managing Chains

### Creating a Base Chain

To create a base chain:

```bash
nft add chain ip filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; policy accept \; }
```

This creates a base chain named "input" in the "filter" table with:
- Hook: input (packets destined for the local system)
- Priority: 0 (standard filter priority)
- Default policy: accept

### Creating a Regular Chain

To create a regular chain (not attached to a hook):

```bash
nft add chain ip filter my_chain
```

### Deleting a Chain

To delete a chain:

```bash
nft delete chain ip filter input
```

### Flushing a Chain

To remove all rules from a chain:

```bash
nft flush chain ip filter input
```

## Managing Rules

### Adding a Rule

To add a rule to a chain:

```bash
nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 22 accept
```

This adds a rule to accept incoming TCP packets on port 22 (SSH).

### Inserting a Rule

To insert a rule at the beginning of a chain:

```bash
nft insert rule ip filter input tcp dport 80 accept
```

### Deleting a Rule

To delete a rule by its handle:

```bash
# First, list rules with handles
nft --handle list chain ip filter input

# Then delete by handle
nft delete rule ip filter input handle 4
```

## Common Firewall Configurations

### Setting Up a Basic Firewall

Here's a basic firewall setup that allows established connections, SSH, and drops all other incoming traffic:

```bash
# Create a table and chains
nft add table inet filter
nft add chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; policy drop \; }
nft add chain inet filter forward { type filter hook forward priority 0 \; policy drop \; }
nft add chain inet filter output { type filter hook output priority 0 \; policy accept \; }

# Allow established and related connections
nft add rule inet filter input ct state established,related accept

# Allow loopback traffic
nft add rule inet filter input iifname lo accept

# Allow SSH
nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 accept

# Allow ICMP and ICMPv6
nft add rule inet filter input ip protocol icmp accept
nft add rule inet filter input ip6 nexthdr icmpv6 accept
```

### Allowing Specific Services

#### HTTP and HTTPS

To allow incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```bash
nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport { 80, 443 } accept
```

#### DNS

To allow outgoing DNS queries:

```bash
nft add rule inet filter output udp dport 53 accept
nft add rule inet filter output tcp dport 53 accept
```

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

#### Setting Up Masquerading (Source NAT)

To enable NAT for outgoing traffic from a private network:

```bash
nft add table nat
nft add chain nat postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority 100 \; }
nft add rule nat postrouting ip saddr 192.168.1.0/24 oifname eth0 masquerade
```

#### Port Forwarding (Destination NAT)

To forward incoming traffic on port 80 to an internal server:

```bash
nft add table nat
nft add chain nat prerouting { type nat hook prerouting priority -100 \; }
nft add rule nat prerouting iifname eth0 tcp dport 80 dnat to 192.168.1.100
```

## Advanced Features

### Using Sets

Sets allow efficient matching against multiple values:

```bash
# Create a set
nft add set ip filter blocked_ips { type ipv4_addr \; }

# Add elements to the set
nft add element ip filter blocked_ips { 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2 }

# Use the set in a rule
nft add rule ip filter input ip saddr @blocked_ips drop
```

### Using Maps

Maps associate keys with values:

```bash
# Create a map
nft add map ip filter port_map { type inet_service : verdict \; }

# Add elements to the map
nft add element ip filter port_map { 22 : accept, 80 : accept, 443 : accept }

# Use the map in a rule
nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport vmap @port_map
```

### Rate Limiting

To limit the rate of incoming connections:

```bash
nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 22 limit rate 3/minute accept
```

This limits SSH connections to 3 per minute.

## Saving and Restoring Rules

nftables rules are not persistent by default and will be lost after a system reboot. To save and restore rules:

### Saving Rules

To save the current ruleset to a file:

```bash
nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf
```

### Restoring Rules

To restore rules from a file:

```bash
nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
```

### Enabling the nftables Service

To make nftables rules persistent across reboots:

```bash
# Save current rules
nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable nftables
sudo systemctl start nftables
```

## Comparison with iptables

### Advantages of nftables over iptables

1. **Unified Framework**: One tool for all protocol families
2. **Improved Performance**: Better packet classification algorithm
3. **Atomic Rule Updates**: Multiple rule changes can be applied atomically
4. **Simplified Syntax**: More consistent and readable syntax
5. **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Rules can be updated without flushing the entire table
6. **Better Set Support**: Native support for sets and maps
7. **Simplified Dual-Stack Configuration**: The inet family handles both IPv4 and IPv6

### Equivalent Commands

| iptables Command | nftables Equivalent |
|------------------|---------------------|
| `iptables -L` | `nft list table ip filter` |
| `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT` | `nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 22 accept` |
| `iptables -P INPUT DROP` | `nft add chain ip filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; policy drop \; }` |
| `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE` | `nft add rule ip nat postrouting ip saddr 192.168.1.0/24 masquerade` |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Rules Not Taking Effect

If your rules don't seem to be taking effect, check:

1. Rule order: Rules are processed in order, and processing stops at the first match
2. Default policies: Check your chain default policies
3. Conflicting rules: Look for rules that might be conflicting with each other

#### Syntax Errors

If you encounter syntax errors:

1. Check the syntax carefully, especially quotes and escape characters
2. Use the `-c` option to check syntax without applying changes:
   ```bash
   nft -c 'add rule ip filter input tcp dport 22 accept'
   ```

#### Debugging

To see more detailed information about what nftables is doing:

```bash
nft --debug=all list ruleset
```

### Monitoring nftables Traffic

To monitor packets matching specific rules:

```bash
# Add a counter to a rule
nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 22 counter accept

# Check the counter
nft list chain ip filter input -a
```

## Best Practices

### Security Recommendations

1. **Default Deny**: Start with a default deny policy and explicitly allow only necessary traffic
2. **Least Privilege**: Allow only the minimum access required for services to function
3. **Stateful Filtering**: Use connection tracking to allow related and established connections
4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit your firewall rules
5. **Documentation**: Document your firewall rules and the purpose of each rule

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Sets for Multiple Values**: Instead of multiple rules for similar matches, use sets
2. **Minimize Chain Traversal**: Organize rules to minimize the number of rules that need to be evaluated
3. **Use Appropriate Families**: Use the inet family for dual-stack configurations

## Conclusion

nftables, through the `nft` command, provides a powerful and flexible framework for packet filtering, classification, and manipulation in Linux. Its unified approach, improved performance, and consistent syntax make it a superior alternative to the legacy iptables framework.

While the transition from iptables to nftables may require learning a new syntax and concepts, the benefits in terms of flexibility, performance, and maintainability make it well worth the effort. As Linux distributions continue to adopt nftables as the default firewall solution, mastering the `nft` command becomes increasingly important for system administrators and security professionals.
