# What are HTTP Headers?

HTTP headers are key-value pairs that are included in both HTTP requests and HTTP responses. They are sent _before_ the actual data (the body) and are separated from the body by a blank line. Headers are text-based, making them relatively easy to read and understand.

Here's a simplified example of what some HTTP headers might look like in a request:

```bash
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml
```

And here's an example of some headers in a response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2023 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Unix)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1234
```

## Common HTTP Header Fields

There are many different HTTP headers, each serving a specific purpose. They can be broadly categorized into:

- **Request Headers:** Sent by the client to provide information about the request and the client itself.
- **Response Headers:** Sent by the server to provide information about the response and the server.
- **General Headers:** Can be used in both requests and responses.

Here are some of the most common and important HTTP headers:

### Request Headers

- `Host:`: Specifies the domain name of the server (e.g., `www.example.com`). This is required in HTTP/1.1 requests.
- `User-Agent:`: Identifies the client making the request (e.g., the browser type and version).
- `Accept:`: Specifies the types of content the client is willing to accept (e.g., `text/html`, `image/jpeg`, `application/json`).
- `Accept-Encoding:`: Specifies the encoding methods the client can handle (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate` for compression).
- `Accept-Language:`: Specifies the preferred languages of the client (e.g., `en-US`, `fr-CA`).
- `Cookie:`: Sends cookies (small pieces of data stored by the browser) back to the server.
- `Authorization:`: Provides credentials for authenticating with the server (e.g., for accessing protected resources).
- `Referer:` [sic]: Indicates the URL of the page that linked to the requested resource.
- `If-Modified-Since:`: Makes the request conditional. The server will only send the resource if it has been modified since the specified date.

### Response Headers

- `Content-Type:`: Specifies the type of content in the response body (e.g., `text/html; charset=UTF-8`, `image/jpeg`, `application/json`). This tells the browser how to interpret the data.
- `Content-Length:`: Specifies the size of the response body in bytes.
- `Server:`: Identifies the web server software being used (e.g., `Apache/2.4.41`, `nginx/1.18.0`).
- `Date:`: Indicates the date and time the response was generated.
- `Cache-Control:`: Provides directives for caching the response (e.g., `public`, `private`, `max-age`).
- `Expires:`: Specifies a date and time after which the response should be considered stale.
- `Last-Modified:`: Indicates the date and time the resource was last modified.
- `Set-Cookie:`: Sends cookies from the server to the client.
- `Location:`: Used in redirection responses (3xx status codes) to specify the new URL.
- `ETag`: An identifier for a version of the resource.
