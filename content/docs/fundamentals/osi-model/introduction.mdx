# OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network. It was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**.

The OSI Model consists of **7 layers**, each with specific functions and responsibilities. This layered approach makes it easier for different devices and technologies to work together. It provides a clear structure for **data transmission** and helps in **managing network issues**. The OSI Model is widely used as a **reference** to understand how network systems function.

## Layers of the OSI Model

There are 7 layers in the OSI Model, and each layer has its specific role in handling data:

1. **[Physical Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/physical-layer)**
2. **[Data Link Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/data-link-layer)**
3. **[Network Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/network-layer)**
4. **[Transport Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer)**
5. **[Session Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/session-layer)**
6. **[Presentation Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/presentation-layer)**
7. **[Application Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/application-layer)**

### Layer 1 – Physical Layer

- The **lowest layer** of the OSI reference model.
- Responsible for the **actual physical connection** between devices.
- Handles data in the form of **bits** (0s and 1s).
- Responsible for **transmitting individual bits** from one node to another.
- On receiving data, it **converts signals** into bits and sends them to the **Data Link Layer**, which reassembles the frame.
- **Common devices**: Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables.

## OSI Model – Layer-Wise Explanation

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a conceptual framework developed by **ISO** that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into **7 distinct layers**. Each layer performs a specific role in the data transmission process.

## Layer 1 – Physical Layer

The **Physical Layer** is responsible for the **actual physical connection** between devices. It handles raw data in the form of bits and transmits them over a physical medium. Learn more in the [Physical Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/physical-layer) section.

### Functions of the Physical Layer:

- **Bit Transmission**: Transmits individual bits from one node to the next.
- **Bit Synchronization**: Provides a clock to sync bit transmission between sender and receiver.
- **Bit Rate Control**: Determines the number of bits sent per second.
- **Physical Topologies**: Defines network arrangement (Bus, Star, Mesh, etc.).
- **Transmission Mode**: Supports Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full Duplex modes.
- **Physical Encoding**: Converts bits into signals for transmission.

**Devices:** Hubs, Repeaters, Modems, Cables, Network Interface Cards (NICs), Transceivers

## Layer 2 – Data Link Layer (DLL)

The **Data Link Layer** ensures **error-free delivery** of data from one node to another. Data at this layer is known as a **Frame**.

### Sub-layers:

- **LLC (Logical Link Control)**
- **MAC (Media Access Control)**

### Functions of the Data Link Layer:

- **Framing**: Encapsulates data into frames.
- **Physical Addressing**: Adds MAC addresses to the frame.
- **Error Control**: Detects and retransmits lost/damaged frames.
- **Flow Control**: Maintains consistent data rate.
- **Access Control**: Determines which device can access the channel.

**Devices:** Switches, Bridges

## Layer 3 – Network Layer

The **Network Layer** ensures **data transfer between different networks** and handles **routing and addressing**. The unit of data is a **Packet**. Learn more in the [Network Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/network-layer) section.

### Functions of the Network Layer:

- **Routing**: Selects the shortest/best path for packet delivery.
- **Logical Addressing**: Adds source and destination **IP addresses**.
- **Address Resolution**: Maps logical addresses to physical addresses using protocols like [ARP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/network-layer/arp).

**Devices:** Routers, Layer-3 Switches

## Layer 4 – Transport Layer

The **Transport Layer** ensures **complete and reliable end-to-end delivery** of data. Data here is referred to as **Segments**. Learn more in the [Transport Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer) section.

### Functions of the Transport Layer:

- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks data into segments; reassembles at receiver.
- **Service Point Addressing**: Uses **port numbers** to identify services/processes.
- **[Process-to-Process Communication](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/process-to-process)**: Enables communication between specific applications.
- **[Congestion Control](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/congestion-control)**: Prevents network overload.
- **[Quality of Service](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/quality-of-service)**: Ensures appropriate service levels for different applications.

### Services:

- **Connection-Oriented** (e.g., [TCP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/tcp))
- **Connectionless** (e.g., [UDP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/udp))

**Protocols:** [TCP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/tcp), [UDP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/udp), [SCTP](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/transport-layer/sctp), NetBIOS, PPTP

## Layer 5 – Session Layer

The **Session Layer** manages **sessions** between two communicating devices. It sets up, manages, and terminates communication sessions. Learn more in the [Session Layer](/docs/fundamentals/osi-model/session-layer) section.

### Functions of the Session Layer:

- **Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination**: Creates, manages, and ends communication sessions.
- **Synchronization**: Adds checkpoints to manage data recovery.
- **Dialog Control**: Supports half-duplex or full-duplex communication.
- **Token Management**: Controls access to shared resources in some protocols.

**Protocols:** NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SIP

## Example Flow

> A user sends a message through a **Messenger app** in their browser:
>
> - The **Application Layer** provides the interface.
> - The message is **compressed and optionally encrypted**.
> - Data is then **converted into bits** to be sent across layers.

Each layer processes and adds its own header/trailer before sending it to the next layer below, following the OSI model.

- **Data Formatting:** Ensures data can be read by the receiving application.
- **Encryption/Decryption:** Provides security by encrypting and decrypting data.
- **Compression/Decompression:** Reduces the number of bits transmitted.
- **Character Code Conversion:** Translates between different character encoding systems.

## Layer 7 – Application Layer

Topmost layer in the OSI model. Interfaces directly with the end-user and applications.

### Protocols Used:
- SMTP
- FTP
- DNS
- HTTP/HTTPS

### Functions of the Application Layer:

- **Network Virtual Terminal (NVT):** Allows remote login to host.
- **File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM):** Enables file access, retrieval, and management.
- **Mail Services:** Provides email functionality.
- **Directory Services:** Offers global access to distributed databases.

## How Data Flows in the OSI Model

When data is transmitted between two devices, it travels through all 7 layers from sender to receiver:

### Sender Side (Top to Bottom):
1. **Application Layer:** Creates data.
2. **Presentation Layer:** Formats/encrypts data.
3. **Session Layer:** Establishes connection.
4. **Transport Layer:** Segments data with error checking.
5. **Network Layer:** Adds logical addressing and routes packets.
6. **Data Link Layer:** Frames data with MAC address and error detection.
7. **Physical Layer:** Converts frames into electrical/optical signals.

### Receiver Side (Bottom to Top):
1. **Physical Layer:** Receives signals.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Extracts frames, verifies MAC and errors.
3. **Network Layer:** Routes and reassembles packets.
4. **Transport Layer:** Reorders and checks data segments.
5. **Session Layer:** Manages connection session.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Decrypts and formats data.
7. **Application Layer:** Displays information to user.

## Example: Sending an Email from Person A to Person B

1. **Application Layer:** Person A uses Gmail/Outlook to write email.
2. **Presentation Layer:** Mail is encrypted/formatted.
3. **Session Layer:** A session is established over the internet.
4. **Transport Layer:** Email split into segments with sequence numbers and error-checking.
5. **Network Layer:** Determines best route and adds IP addresses.
6. **Data Link Layer:** Adds MAC address, converts to frames, checks for errors.
7. **Physical Layer:** Frames sent as electrical/optical signals via cables or WiFi.

**At Person B's end:** The process reverses and the email is displayed in their email client.

## Why Does the OSI Model Matter?

- Provides a **clear structure** of how data moves through a network.
- Helps in **troubleshooting** by isolating network issues to specific layers.
- While modern networks often use the TCP/IP model, **OSI is still valuable** as a learning and diagnostic framework.
- Simplifies understanding of complex networking concepts.

## Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Model

| OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
|-----------|---------------|
| Stands for **Open Systems Interconnection** | Stands for **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** |
| Has **7 layers** | Has **4 layers** |
| **Guaranteed** package delivery | Package delivery is **not guaranteed** |
| Only layers 1, 2, 3 are needed for transmission | **All layers** are necessary for transmission |
| **Independent** layers | **Integrated** layers |
| Mostly **theoretical and conceptual** | **Widely used** in practical networks |
| Example: Ethernet (Layer 2), IP (Layer 3) | Used in the **Internet** and most communication systems |

## Advantages of OSI Model

- Breaks communication into **7 manageable layers**.
- Makes **troubleshooting easier** by isolating problems.
- Provides **standardization** across network components.
- **Flexible for updates**, as each layer can evolve independently.

## Disadvantages of OSI Model

- **Too complex** for beginners.
- Not widely implemented in its **pure form** in real-life networks.
- Layer-by-layer processing can be **time-consuming**.
- Acts more as a **conceptual guide** than a practical model.

## Conclusion

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** Model is a **conceptual framework** that defines how data moves across a network using **7 distinct layers**. While the **TCP/IP model** is more practical and widely adopted, OSI still plays a crucial role in **teaching**, **designing**, and **troubleshooting** networks. Understanding the OSI model equips users with the foundational knowledge needed to work with modern networking technologies.
